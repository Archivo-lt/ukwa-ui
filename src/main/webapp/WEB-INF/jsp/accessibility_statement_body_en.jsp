<h2 id="compliance-status">Compliance Status</h2>
<p>This website is not compliant with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018. The non-compliances and the exemptions are listed below.</p>

<h2 id="non-accessible-content">Non accessible content</h2>
<p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

<h3 id="non-compliance-with-the-accessibility-regulations">Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
<p><strong>Info and Relationships [1.3.1]</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Issue:</strong></em> <strong>Related form elements are not grouped</strong>. Checkboxes and radio buttons are not semantically grouped using fieldset. Screen reader users may not be able to easily identify the purpose and relationships between the input and label. This doesn&rsquo;t meet WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 1.3.1</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Resolution:</strong></em> We will ensure related input controls are semantically grouped so that assistive technologies can recognise the relationship of the elements by January 2020. When we publish new content we&rsquo;ll make sure our use of input controls meets accessibility standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Issue:</strong></em> <strong>Headings are not structured</strong>. Heading elements are declared on most pages beginning with a heading level 2. Screen reader users may rely on the presence of a heading level 1 element on a page for orientation purposes. This doesn&rsquo;t meet WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 1.3.1</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Resolution:</strong></em> We will ensure heading elements begin with a heading level 1 by January 2020. When we publish new content we&rsquo;ll make sure our use of heading elements meets accessibility standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Issue:</strong></em> <strong>Input purpose not identified on the form input element</strong> which takes in a URL from the user as an autocomplete property is not provided. Having this would allow the purpose of the input to be programmatically determined by assistive technologies. This doesn&rsquo;t meet WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 1.3.5</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Resolution:</strong></em> We will provide the autocomplete property to allow assistive technologies to present common values by January 2020. When we publish new content we&rsquo;ll make sure our use of input purposes meets accessibility standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Contrast [1.4.3]</strong></p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Issue:</strong></em> <strong>Text does not meet contrast requirement</strong>. The faint text colour may affect users with sight impairment. This doesn&rsquo;t meet WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 1.4.3</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Resolution:</strong></em> We will use a darker shade for the text to achieve higher contrast by January 2020. When we publish new content we&rsquo;ll make sure a minimum contrast ration of 4.5:1 applied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Reflow [1.4.10]</strong></p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Issue:</strong></em> <strong>Left navigation disappears when zoomed at 400%,</strong> users may not be able to access the filter functionality as a result. This doesn&rsquo;t meet WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 1.4.10</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Resolution:</strong></em> We will ensure there is no loss of features when the page is zoomed up to 400%. When we publish new content we&rsquo;ll make sure there is no loss of features when the page is zoomed up to 400%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Keyboard [2.1.1]</strong></p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Issue:</strong></em> <strong>Interactive elements are not focusable to keyboard</strong>. The &ldquo;X&rdquo; clear filter button and previous page button do not receive keyboard focus when viewed on the desktop browser. Keyboard users are not able to activate the button element. While the element can be accessed using the screen reader arrow keys there is no announcement of the label or role available. The button element is also not responding when activated using a screen reader. As a result users dependent on a keyboard and non-sighted users may not be able to interact with the element. This doesn&rsquo;t meet WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 2.1.1</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Resolution:</strong></em> We will ensure that all interactive elements available to a mouse pointer are also available to the keyboard keys by January 2020. When we publish new content we&rsquo;ll make sure our use of interactive elements meets accessibility standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Issue</strong>:</em> <strong>No keyboard trap</strong>. When keyboard and screen reader users tab onto the custom tooltip on the filter panel focus is trapped. As a result screen reader and keyboard users are not able to navigate the contents within the page without using mouse interaction. This doesn&rsquo;t meet WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 2.1.2</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Resolution:</strong></em> We will ensure that focus is not trapped onto the tooltip by January 2020. When we publish new content we&rsquo;ll make sure our use of interactive elements meets accessibility standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Language of parts [3.1.2]</strong></p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Issue:</strong></em> <strong>Foreign language not declared</strong>. Text in a foreign language other than the primary language of the document is not marked with an appropriate language code. Screen readers might use the current language preference to read the site entirely which is not the intended outcome. This doesn&rsquo;t meet WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 3.1.2</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Resolution:</strong></em> We will provide a lang attribute with the appropriate language code to elements containing foreign language by January 2020. When we publish new content we&rsquo;ll make sure we declare foreign language text appropriately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>On input [3.2.2]</strong></p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Issue:</strong></em> <strong>Overlay present when search button is pressed</strong>. When the search button is activated an overlay is presented while the keyboard focus is lost. Once the progress overlay is completed focus is reset to the top of the page. Non-sighted users may not be aware of the changes on screen and this may cause disorientation. This doesn&rsquo;t meet WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 3.2.2</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Resolution:</strong></em> We will provide a screen reader only text to communicate the overlay behaviour to screen reader users by January 2020. When we publish new content we&rsquo;ll make sure our use of interaction with controls meets accessibility standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Label or instructions [3.3.2]</strong></p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Issue:</strong></em> <strong>Placeholder label not announced by screen reader</strong>. The date format is presented via the placeholder text which is not announced by screen readers. Screen reader users may not be aware of the valid format for the input fields. This doesn&rsquo;t meet WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 3.3.2</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Resolution:</strong></em> We will ensure the date format is made visible next to the label instead of appearing as a placeholder which will ensure the label is announced by screen readers by January 2020. When we publish new content we&rsquo;ll make sure our use of labels meets accessibility standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Name, role, value [4.1.2]</strong></p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Issue:</strong></em> <strong>Custom radio buttons are not semantically declared with appropriate role, name and state</strong>. Screen reader users may not be able to perceive the purpose and recognise the behaviour of the controls without sufficient semantic context added. This doesn&rsquo;t meet WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 4.1.2</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Resolution:</strong></em> We will use native HTML radio elements to ensure full accessibility support by all browsers and assistive technologies by January 2020. When we publish new content we&rsquo;ll make sure our use of radio buttons meets accessibility standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Issue:</strong></em> <strong>Custom checkbox not semantically declared with appropriate role, name and state</strong>. Screen reader users may not be able to perceive the purpose and recognise the behaviour of the controls without sufficient semantic context added. This doesn&rsquo;t meet WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 4.1.2</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Resolution:</strong></em> We will use native HTML checkbox elements to ensure full accessibility support by all browsers and assistive technologies by January 2020. When we publish new content we&rsquo;ll make sure our use of custom check boxes meets accessibility standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Issue:</strong></em> <strong>Custom tooltip not declared with ARIA</strong>. The tooltip buttons on the filter panel can be focussed and activated using a keyboard only however there are issues with the tooltip control when accessing with a screen reader turned on: it is not declared with the correct state and the tooltip text is not announced by the screen reader. Screen reader users may not hear the label of the button and the tooltip text. This doesn&rsquo;t meet WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 4.1.2</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Resolution:</strong></em> We will ensure the tooltip is properly declared by January 2020. When we publish new content we&rsquo;ll make sure our use of tooltips meets accessibility standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Status Messages [4.1.3]</strong></p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li><p><em><strong>Issue:</strong></em> Progress bar not announced by screen reader. When the search button is activated, an overlay is presented but the search progress status is not announced by the screen reader. Non-sighted users may not be aware of the changes on screen and this may cause disorientation. This doesn&rsquo;t meet WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 4.1.3</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Resolution:</strong></em> We will ensure the search progress message is announced by the screen reader by January 2020. When we publish new content we&rsquo;ll make sure our use of status messages meets accessibility standards.</p>
