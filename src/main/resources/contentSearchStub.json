Tribute band Black Rose are coming to the Swinging Arm pub in Birkenhead this Friday to continue Phil Lynott and Thin Lizzy’s musical legacy. Formed in July 2010, Black Rose features four members – Roger Dyson on bass and lead vocals, Patrick Noone on drums, Chris Lord and Scott Broadhurst playing lead guitar and backing vocals. The band are named after Thin Lizzy’s ninth album – Black Rose: A Rock Legend. They are based in Lancashire and have been touring the North West and beyond since 2011. They have gained praise for staying true to the faithful re-creation of the live Lizzy sound, and producing an energetic show. Music lovers can expect all the hits, such as Jail Break, Waiting for an Alibi, The Boys Are Back In Town, Whiskey In The Jar, and more. Scott said: “Since we formed the band has gone from strength to strength. “We are always busy gigging across the north west playing at festivals and at times travelling further afield. “We put on a two-hour high energy show playing all the Lizzy classics. “Also all the surprises thrown in that you won’t get from any other Thin Lizzy tribute act. “We have a broad repertoire of over 50 songs, covering all the big hits plus album tracks which other bands don’t tend to play. “Our set changes at each venue – as we play requests and what people want to hear. “We love to play songs which get people moving and like to play to the crowd – that’s what it’s all about. “I’ve been a life-long fan of Thin Lizzy as my parents named me after Scott Gorham the guitar player. “This summer we have festivals lined up, and will be playing in Ireland in August for Phil Lynott’s memorial birthday bash. “This will be our second time performing at the Swinging Arm. “We played the first time round earlier this year in January. “It was a packed house and really good fun. “We are looking forward to Friday and can’t wait. “This will be final gig at the Swinging Arm for this year as we are booked up for the rest of 2014. “So we won’t be back here until next year. “It’s free entry, so we hope lots of people will come down and see us play – pack the place out like last time.” Black Rose will be at Swinging Arm in Birkenhead   Black Rose will be playing from 9pm this Friday at the Church Street venue. But it is advised to get down early to get a spot as it was a full house last time.   Follow @WirralNews @Linda_Foo_Guest Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Recently Published Fresh worries over Tranmere Rovers' plans to sell off Ingleborough training ground to developers Sport England says more details are needed on the revised proposals Ridgeway pupils honour Great War in WWI centenary year Hoylake beer festival returns this bank holiday Previous Articles Childhood home of a Wimbledon legend Wirral roots of a Wimbledon legend World Autism Awareness day supported in Wirral Frank Field: Local GPs are walking away from their patients Related Tags Places Birkenhead Most Read in What's On The Gladstone Theatre Mercury frontman Joseph Lee Jackson on becoming Freddie Mercury and the band’s return to Wirral Floral Pavilion The Floral Pavilion opens new Blue Lounge performance space for live music and arts events What's On News Canadian-born singer Dean Austin performing at Leasowe Castle Country & Western Music Club Food & Drink Oak Tree is a dining paradise just waiting to be discovered What's On News Liverpool's best beer gardens What's on tonight?   Find things to do near you that you'll love Most Recent in What's On Facebook 17 year old Wirral singer wins American Idol stars worldwide contest Facebook Wirral Rehearsal Studios Launches new web TV Music Show What's On News Grab your Hawaiian shirts for a ukulele concert in Wirral Music & Nightlife Rock through Generations of metal at Wirral gig What's On News Wirral will sparkle when OMD take the plunge Tranmere Rovers   All the latest news from Prenton Park Most Read on the Wirral news News Ten-year-old boy charged with stealing urn from Mersey cemetery following probe into vandalism of 100 graves Local News Woman thrown off horse in crash with car at Wirral roundabout Local News 'Mean and nasty' Mersey care boss jailed after stealing thousands from elderly residents and in donations to home News The Red Fox in Thornton Hough, formerly the Grange, is scheduled to open in December Wirral Council ‘Friends’ group handed keys to kennels Looking back   Fantastic images of the Wirral's history Follow Us Contact Us Send A Story Advertise Join us on social media.

The other Vale batsmen struggled against Antony Francis (5-70) and Tom Light (4-27) as they were bowled out for 190. Philip Whatmore's 47 gave Town some hope, but veteran left arm seamer Danny Hartley (3-39) and Mike Cook (3-57) helped bowl out the visitors for 161. Abingdon Vale 25pts, Leighton Buzzard Town 8. All-rounder James Phillips took 5-40 and then hit an unbeaten 43 to take Challow & Childrey to an easy win over Oxford & Bletchingdon Nondescripts and top spot in the table. Put into bat, Nondies were bundled out for 135, and they would not have made three figures without Pablo Mukherjee's 63. Olly Dimbylow took 3-25 for Challow, and the result was never in doubt once Phillips and Nick Meadows (70) put on 106 for the first wicket in their reply. Challow & Childrey 25, Oxford & Bletchingdon Nondescripts 5. Tiddington were undone by Adam Wells of Long Marston, who took 6-48 to bowl his side to a 37-run victory. Marston had been bowled out for 193 after being asked to bat first, Mick Lyons getting things going with 33 before Martin Wright finished off the innings with 91 not out. In reply, only John Mackie (41) got going for the visitors, who crumbled to 156 all out against Wells and Lee Beesley (3-25). Long Marston 25, Tiddington 7. Milton Keynes Park's batsmen failed yet again in a six-wicket defeat at Bourton Vale. Park had been bowled out for 80 and 126 in the previous two weeks and this time were reduced to 64-8 before Ghufran Mohammed (40) took them to 121 all out. Steven Stroud (4-48), Ben Hughes (3-12) and Graham Newhook (3-62) all enjoyed success for Vale, who eased home. Bourton Vale 25, Milton Keynes Park 5. Michael Sutcliff (67), Ashley Smith (43) and Tim Brooker (33) helped Dinton to 223-9 from their 52 overs at bottom club Bledlow Ridge, who had elected to field first. Stephen Buhagiar took 5-91 and Mark Dakin 3-56 for the hosts, whose innings was then reduced to 43 overs by a shower. Matt Orford hit 63 and John Rolfe 30 not out, but wickets tumbled and they had to settle for a draw on 192-8. Bledlow Ridge 11, Dinton 15.

They are unreliable and inefficient. Just blots on the landscape. Worse still, are the plethora of high electricity pylons which have been allowed to straddle our countryside virtually unchecked since the 1950s. Calling time on such defacement is one thing, especially as 1,500 of the juggernaut pylons are in national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty. But spending £500m over the next eight years burying just 65 pylons covering only 12 short sections – the nearest being in Snowdonia and the Peak District – is an absolute folly. The maths work out at £7m per pylon, and are beyond national or international reason i.e. half as much as the high speed rail line from Folkestone to London, or 40% more than the line from Paris to Strasbourg. Some things are just too expensive to contemplate. This is the latest example. We have been warned: Liverpool-London trains will be the most disrupted this Christmas, adding two hours to journeys on December 27 and 28, as Network Rail unleashes 52 holiday work schemes. Plus no local rail on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, and once again it's a case of fewest trains when most needed. This has never failed to amaze: surely some folk could be persuaded, with an adequate pay bonus, to run our trains at peak efficiency when more than 20 million trips are the expected norm. Meanwhile, the idea that even in a modern manufacture-starved economy, we should be jumping for joy at a 10% increase in new car sales, is ludicrous. Even in a region where motor and allied services contribute billions. Ultimately, this metallic production line cannot be maintained, contributing more pollution and congestion. Which is why we should be encouraging greater use of public transport, if only it was properly managed (see above). George W Bush will best be remembered as a Republican warmonger. Yet his newly published portrait of his father, George H. W. Bush reveals an intriguing on-going geniality with opponent Democrats Bill Clinton and Barrack Obama. Beyond the White House George Jnr got George Snr and Clinton to work together raising hundreds of millions for international disaster relief. Since then, Obama has bestowed the highest civilian presidential honour on George Snr. Can you imagine Silverspoon Cameron persuading John Major and Gordon Brown to undertake some joint act of humanity or being able to bestow a Medal of Freedom on Tony Blair? Plainly not. Mine eyes have seen the glories of the refurbished Philharmonic Hall: the new entrance; the elegant bar – but what of the concert space? Eye-wateringly white and bright (take your sunglasses) with remodelled platform seating....but something's missing. Ah yes, that mobile sculpture on the back wall, with the official name of Adagio, and a far ruder nickname bestowed by the orchestra. “We are working with our partners to find it a new home,” said a voice from on high. Mmm. Sounds like the storage room to me.   Follow theliverpoolecho @LivEchonews Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Recently Published Watch:Dingle woman quizzed by murder detectives as stab victim described as 'nice guy' Keen footballer, 21, died in hospital after being stabbed in chest Morning news headlines: UKIP aim for new election game; patient drug promise; Charles will speak out Aigburth Cricket Club launches court challenge in bid to avoid eviction Previous Articles Morning news headlines: 'Lottery' for child abuse victims, warning over mental health spending The latest news from around the world Liverpool and Manchester should collaborate to grow economy Merseyside hospitals spent £67m on temporary workers last year Related Tags In The News Politics Recommended in News Facebook Live: Breaking news from Liverpool and Merseyside for Friday December 19 Hillsborough Inquests Five things we learned at the Hillsborough inquests today, December 19 Liverpool Liverpool's Pakistani community mourns Peshawar attack victims in candle-lighting ceremonies Crime Teen thug Connor McHugh behind bars after vicious attack on Walton grandad Hillsborough Inquests Kenny Dalglish told Hillsborough inquests he went on pitch after match was stopped to check on 12-year-old son Get your home ready for winter   Hints, tips and more from British Gas Most Read in News Crime Police hunt three men over PC Neil Doyle killing as force probe that he was 'recognised as an officer' before being attacked Liverpool City Centre Liverpool murder probe: Doormen tried in vain to save off-duty police officer killed in city centre assault Liverpool News CCTV footage released after woman wakes to find intruder in the bedroom doorway of her Liverpool flat Crime Teen thug Connor McHugh behind bars after vicious attack on Walton grandad Crime Murder investigation: off-duty police officer dies in Liverpool city centre assault BuySell   Buy & sell items including cars and houses, or browse thousands of ads Buy a photo   Explore our amazing archive Recommended on the Echo David Moyes Everton stopper Tim Howard believes finding a long-term 'keeper is a tough job Everton FC Tim Howard urges Everton FC fans to layoff the boos Facebook Live: Breaking news from Liverpool and Merseyside for Friday December 19 Liverpool FC Mamadou Sakho set to make his first league start for three months Hillsborough Inquests Five things we learned at the Hillsborough inquests today, December 19 Send Your Story   Got a story?

A plan was in place to manage this. Councillors noted that internal audit had looked at disaster continuity arrangements and had given “full assurance” in April 2009. The Committee was content with the progress made. Councillors recognised that, as there were risk management and business continuity procedures across the council and the process was almost complete, the reporting frequency could be reduced to once a year. Councillors requested that in case of a disruption to the council’s telephone system, officers should investigate a recorded message to inform the public of the problem. RESOLVED (by six votes to nil) (a) To note the progress made in developing and improving the council’s business continuity arrangements to meet the needs of shared working with South Oxfordshire District Council and the associated revised management structure; and (b) To introduce an annual reporting frequency for business continuity and risk management matters. Vale of White Horse District Council – Audit and Governance Committee minutes Wednesday, 30TH June, 2010 AG.3 AG.7 Internal audit annual report 2009/10 The Committee considered report 14/10 of the Head of Finance. This reported on the work of the council’s internal audit service during 2009/10 and advised on the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control environment. The committee noted the Head of Finance’s unqualified opinion of satisfactory assurance with the council’s risk management, control, and governance processes. He believed the council had a sound system of internal control but found some weaknesses that might put some system objectives at risk. Service managers had welcomed the control improvements suggested by internal audit. The Committee agreed with the Head of Finance that the internal audit team had performed well. RESOLVED To note the report. AG.8 Internal audit activity first quarter 2010/11 The Committee considered report 15/10 of the Head of Finance. It summarised the outcome of recent internal audit activity. Appended to the report was one audit report on how the council managed creditor payments in 2009/10. Internal audit awarded a limited assurance rating only. The Committee noted that the actions outstanding from the last audit were complete and monitored monthly. The audit had highlighted a problem with aged-debt. However, the results showed an exaggerated debt due to the audit being undertaken the week the precepts were being paid to parish councils, making the debt abnormally high. In answer to a question from a councillor, the audit reports with a satisfactory or full assurance rating would be available to the committee on the council’s website. The officers would notify councillors by email when the reports were available and would provide a link to the relevant webpage. All councillors were encouraged to access the council’s intranet. RESOLVED To note the report. AG.9 Internal audit management report first quarter 2010/11 The Committee considered report 16/10 of the Head of Finance. This reported on internal audit management issues, summarised progress against the audit plan, and set out priorities for quarter two in 2010/11. Councillors noted that a new auditor would start shortly. The report referred to audits undertaken for South Oxfordshire District Council solely and jointly with the Vale. Councillors asked that the review of the constitution should Vale of White Horse District Council – Audit and Governance Committee minutes Wednesday, 30TH June, 2010 AG.4 consider how far Vale councillors could discuss matters relating to South Oxfordshire, when comparing performance to the Vale. RESOLVED (a) To note the report; and (b) To invite the Constitution Advisory Group to debate how far Vale councillors can discuss matters relating to South Oxfordshire District Council, when comparing performance to the Vale. AG.10 Treasury Management - review of activity 2009/10 Councillors Richard Farrell and Mike Mackay both declared personal interests in this item. Complying with the council’s standing order 34, they remained in the meeting for this item. The Committee considered report 17/10 of the Head of Finance, which reviewed treasury management activity in 2009/10. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy had recommended that the council’s treasury management activity should be scrutinised by a committee other than the Executive. The Audit and Governance Committee had this responsibility. The Executive would consider a similar report on 2 July. The report highlighted the performance of cash invested by the in-house team and that managed by Investec, the council’s appointed investment manager. Performance was also analysed by Butlers, the council’s investment adviser. The in- house team achieved a return of 1.07 per cent, while Investec achieved 1.31 per cent. Butlers concluded that the return on investment was lower than initially anticipated due to low interest rates. However, Butlers did not recommended any changes to the council’s approach as this allowed a balance of top-quality investments and good liquidity. The committee thanked the officer for the report but asked where it showed the loss of investment in the Icelandic bank, Landsbanki. The officer reported that this had occurred in the previous year. The council was writing off the losses over several years although it hoped to receive compensation for the majority of the loss. The committee considered that the report should cover both the good and bad news and recommended the Executive that the 2009/10 report should reflect the loss of investment. The committee congratulated the in-house team for its performance in 2009/10. RESOLVED (by eight votes to nil) (a) To note the return of cash invested during 2009/10 and the balances of funds at 31 March 2010 and congratulate the in-house team on its performance; (b) To note the prospects for the return on cash investments in 2010/11; and Vale of White Horse District Council – Audit and Governance Committee minutes Wednesday, 30TH June, 2010 AG.5 (c) To recommend the Executive that treasury management reports should reflect both the good and bad news and that the 2009/10 report should reflect the loss of investment in the Icelandic bank, Landsbanki. AG.11 Statement of accounts 2009/10 The Committee considered report 18/10 of the Head of Finance, which sought approval of the draft statement of accounts 2009/10. The Accounts and Audit Regulations 2003 required the council to approve the draft statement of accounts for external audit by 30 June each year. The committee had authority to approve the draft. The committee reviewed the draft and asked the officers to insert the correct figure for the total contribution to the pension scheme. The statement of account included the annual governance statement also. The committee asked for changes to the paragraph referring to testing anti-fraud and corruption measures. The annual governance statement also included Audit Commission assurances on the council’s governance framework; the Audit Commission asked for their removal. RESOLVED (by eight votes to nil) To approve the “statement of accounts 2009/10” for audit. AG.12 Audit and governance work programme The committee reviewed the remainder of its work programme for the 2010/11. The added one item for 15 September 2010, that being the Audit Commission’s annual governance statement. RESOLVED To agree the remainder of the 2010/11 work programme, including the Audit Commission’s annual governance statement on 15 September 2010. AG.13 Audit and inspection fee 2010/11 The Audit Commission had advised the council of its likely audit and inspection fee for 2010/11. This was set out in a letter circulated to all committee members. Anne Ockleston, from the Audit Commission, reported two changes to the detail set out in the letter. Firstly, the new coalition government had cancelled work on the comprehensive are assessments for local authorities. Secondly, this meant that the scored use of resources assessment would not take place also. This meant that the audit and inspection fee would be lower than shown in the letter, that being £108,665. However, the Audit Commission warned that another assessment could replace the scored use of resources assessment. Councillors noted that the Audit Commission would update the committee in September. Vale of White Horse District Council – Audit and Governance Committee minutes Wednesday, 30TH June, 2010 AG.6 RESOLVED To note the audit and inspection fee for 2010/11. AG.14 International financial reporting standard The Chair asked for a report to the next committee meeting on how the council would implement the new international financial reporting standards. He wished to know if there was an implementation plan, which officer was responsible for implementing the plan, and did the council have the capacity to undertake this work. RESOLVED To request that the officers report to the next committee meeting on 15 September 2010 on implementing the new international financial reporting standards. Exempt information under Section 100A(4) of the Local Government Act 1972 None The meeting rose at 8.16 pm"],

I thought it would be interesting to open a discussion about the products that stood out most to me – let me know if you agree or disagree with my picks. Admittedly, I was excited about these products before my plane even departed for Taipei, but the new Corsair RGB keyboards didn't disappoint. The Cherry MX RGB switches are unique to Corsair, giving them a real edge over the competition. The backlighting on the K70 RGB and the K95 RGB is more even with the new switch design, but the real win here is the full per-key colour and brightness customisation – the number of lighting patterns you can program is essentially limitless, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what the community comes up with, as lighting profiles can be saved, uploaded and shared. Click to enlarge All keys can now be reprogrammed with different functions and macros, so practically the keyboards have improved massively over the previous generation ones – the original K70, which I currently use, has zero macro functionality. From what I saw, Corsair has done a good job in improving its software too, so there's plenty to be excited about. These keyboards aren’t going to be cheap, but even so I expect them to fly off the shelves when they're released, probably in early August. Click to enlarge Both the new Raijintek all-in-one liquid cooler (currently without name) and the Fractal Design Kelvin series of AIO coolers also stood out to me, in both cases because they're not actually entirely sealed units. Raijintek approaches this from a mostly aesthetic standpoint, offering transparent tubing and a transparent waterblock/tank unit and four different coolant colours. The price tag of £75 is also very strong for a 240mm radiator cooler, and I'm interested to see how well the slimline fans can keep up with the competition. Click to enlarge Fractal, on the other hand, has an approach based on future proofing and expansion. For starters, it offers a refill point and standard diameter brass fittings on the waterblock and radiator, allowing you to swap out and replace components as you see fit. Furthermore, it has also built a more powerful pump (courtesy of a conjoined effort with Alphacool) into each of the Kelvin units, such that they can cope with users adding another waterblock or radiator into the loop, for example. It's a cool approach that could well encourage novice water-coolers to start experimenting with custom loops. Click to enlarge I was reluctant to include a company twice here, but after looking through everything I saw, I had to admit that of all the cases on show it was the Corsair Carbide Air 240 that had me most excited. That said, the new Be Quiet! chassis and the Antec P380 with its 5mm thick aluminium shell both had me wanting samples ASAP. Click to enlarge Nevertheless, the Air 240 looks really sleek, and Corsair has done well in shrinking the dual chamber design of the Air 540 to micro-ATX dimensions. The fact that you can also rotate it to have the window positioned left, right or on top also gets my seal of approval, as this means you can always show off your build regardless of where you need to put the case on your desk. After writing a NUC feature for Custom PC last year that included reviews of passive NUC cases, I was convinced that passive is the only way forward for mini-PCs – I'm a big fan of low-noise and silent computing as it is. As such, the Zotac C-Series of Zbox mini-PCs also makes this list. Click to enlarge Pleasingly, Zotac hasn't just made the chassis into a giant heatsink in order to achieve passive cooling – it's still dinky, and as it's made of metal I think it looks better than the traditional glossy black casing too. With a Core i5 model available, it's not short on processing power, though the single channel memory is a shame. Nevertheless, with support for 6Gbps 2.5-inch SSDs and heaps of connectivity, the C-series Zbox range could be a real hit in the mini-PC market, provided noise from power components isn't an issue. Click to enlarge The final thing from Computex 2014 that stood out most to me was a motherboard range. However, it wasn't a gaming or overclock series of boards that caught my eye, nor was it an X99 motherboard; it was MSI's Eco motherboard range, designed with a core focus on reducing power consumption. I particularly like the user friendly software that allows users to quickly enable and disable various system components (within reason). I also have to admit that I'm really into the white PCB MSI used to demo the H97M ECO. The design still needs some work (the beige connectors aren't great, for example), but it's not a final product yet, and it has the potential to be something rather special. What do you think of my choices? Have I missed anything that you thought was the star of the show?

I'd like a pump/wb/res combo like this one. Gareth Halfacree 12th June 2014, 11:06 Quote: Originally Posted by GuilleAcoustic That Raijin AIO looks nice, too bad about those screws on the fans. It looks very unprofessionnal Looks to me like they've been taking the screws out to show the radiator behind the fans; note that several screws aren't fully screwed in, and others are missing entirely. I'd imagine they simply put enough screws in far enough that the fans wouldn't fall off, in order to make taking 'em off next time somebody wants a picture of the radiator sans-fans easier. S'what I'd do. David164v8 12th June 2014, 11:19 Is the Raijintek also expandable to the GPU etc? Impatience 12th June 2014, 11:19 Best of all is they're planning to have them in stores by the end of July! I emailed them, to check on the release date. As opposed to the date in X weeks time.. (i'm not good with dates!) @David, it is expandable (standard G1/4 fittings) and apparently the pump *should* be powerful enough to extend with a single GPU block and still work.. Block dependant, i'd assume! So that's me settled on buying one! :) MSHunter 12th June 2014, 11:45 Got to love the massive air bubble in the tube. Really un-pro display. The idea sounds nice but this is very poor execution. Any way is the reservoir not supposed to be at the highest point in the loop to ketch any air in the system? In AIO systems thats not so important because they are supposed to QA to make sure it is 99.9% full. I guess this is just a very early test sample....... tonyd223 12th June 2014, 12:04 air bubble.... SchizoFrog 12th June 2014, 12:41 It doesn't matter where in the loop a res is as long as the 'res in' tube is above the 'res out' tube. Air from the 'res in' tube will be pushed through the tubing and once in the res will rise to the top leaving only coolant to continue to flow on and out. To ease this process you can manually hold the res up to the highest point and once the air has entered and separated in the res, move and fix the res to your chosen desired location. I have recently seen several comments regarding the noise of AIO pumps, as a new comer to this area I want to know 'are they really that loud'? I thought water cooling in general was supposed to lower noise, not increase it. On a different note, I am very eager for the new Corsair RGB keyboards but the one I would be waiting for (if it was confirmed) would be a K65? version without the number pad. Any news on if Corsair plans to release one at some point in the future?

I'm surprised the premise isn't more common, but just to be clear - is it only software controlled or can you also disable things via EFI/BIOS?. I also don't understand why white PCBs aren't more common. I only remember 1 other white PCB board made by Sapphire. dstarr3 12th June 2014, 16:27 I can't wait for the Logitech G-series keyboards to go mechanical. I have an early G15, and I love the eighteen macro keys, the backlighting, and the screen. The Corsair keyboard above looks brilliant, except it doesn't have the screen I've gotten VERY used to. The screen can be programmed to display so much useful information, I don't think I could do without it anymore. SchizoFrog 12th June 2014, 18:40 Something that I haven't seen covered on Bit-Tech was the new stuff from Cryorig...

They were not covered though as part of Computex where they actually had them on display. IvanIvanovich 13th June 2014, 04:08 I wish MSI would use that white and lime colorscheme on an ATX motherboard with m.2, and no PCI slots, no vga dsub, or other legacy connectors. It's been way too long since there have been some nice white PCB motherboards. That could be a good move to set themselves apart instead of using black and red like pretty much everyone else on everything. thom804 13th June 2014, 07:57 That Silverstone prototype successor to the TJ11 looked nuts!

I totally accept what you are saying and I wasn't criticising. I just found the article on Toms to be interesting and relevant as it was of Computex and it had actual images of the products talked about and I posted the link for those who may wish to take a look. Had your previous article had the same images then I would have already had that in mind and would never have posted my comment with the link.

Yay, someone else who admits to liking the Logitech gaming k/boards, (I know many of the compact mechanical k/board lovers hate them :D) Logitechs G710+ mechanical k/board looks nice but no screen and I as you say the screen is so useful when gaming as I hate on-screen in game displays like Riva tuner so I use the LCD to show Afterburner and HWinfo64 information, I also like the Logitech gaming software so it would be a pain to have to learn another program if I bought another brand of k/board. There was a time when some mech k/board makers would never entertain k/board lighting but the new Corsair RGB keyboards have gone nuts with it and I like that every key can be now be programmed, come on Logitech keep up, mech k/board with a big touch screen is what I'd like to see so the touch screen could also be used as a virtual k/board for inputting passwords and security data (amongst other things) instead of using virus vulnerable keystrokes. IvanIvanovich 13th June 2014, 17:47 Why not run a second monitor with touch capability then, even if it's a smaller usb one? Seems like it would be a lot more potentially useful than some tiny screen stuck on a keyboard. Also, a touch/virtual keyboard has zero security over a regular keyboard. Those are susceptible to keyloggers and other capture techniques too.

I thought water cooling in general was supposed to lower noise, not increase it. A problem ever since water cooling came up. Even back when fish-tank-pumps were used, almost no website tested the noise level of the pump. Flow at different tubing sizes should be easy, but that also often isn't measured. I understand that (accurate) noise testing is difficult and expensive. but just like you said, for me, water cooling was about noise, not improved cooling. I was amazed to see a noise measurement in the recent PSU roundup here on Bit. Air cooling has become so silent though, I don't care about WC anymore. ;) Log in You are not logged in, please login with your forum account below.

Posted on 16th Jul 2014 at 09:05 by Rick Lane with 10 comments Dearest readers of bit-tech! Come hither and listen to my whispered words, as I am a troubled soul. For a long time now I have lamented the lack of progress made in the AI sphere of game development. In the years surrounding the millennium AI was bold and bright and exciting.

This continued until around 2005, with FEAR being the last game I can recall with truly memorable AI. Then something changed, and after that nothing changed. Stealth AI has patrolled the same pathways for years, shooter AI crouched behind a wall circa 2006 and decided to make a home there, and when was the last time you played a game that involved the AI learning anything?

Reports that a trail of destruction had been left through Flaybrick Hill – now Flaybrick Memorial Gardens – on Tollemache Road, Claughton, came in to police on May 23. It is believed more than 100 gravestones and memorials were badly damaged the previous night at the historic site, which opened in 1864 and ceased as an active cemetery in 1975. Two of the headstones that have been damaged A 10-year-old boy from Birkenhead was arrested in June initially on suspicion of criminal damage and theft in connection with the incident. He has now been charged with theft and has been bailed to appear before Wirral youth court on September 2. It is understood the urn has never been recovered by police. Two other boys, a 15-year-old and a 13-year-old from Prenton, were also arrested on suspicion of criminal damage earlier in the investigation and both remain on police bail until next month. The site, now a memorial gardens within the Flaybrick Cemetery Conservation Area, is no longer used for burials or the interment of ashes except for within existing family plots. Watch video of the damage done back in May: Video loading Repair work on the damaged gravestones is currently being carried out by the council and is set to take several months to complete. Following the vandalism, George Dodd, from Prenton, told the ECHO of his disgust at the state he found the site in after going to visit a family plot at the cemetery. He said: “I went down to visit the grave for my grandfather, grandmother and two sisters, who both died young aged five and one. “As I walked into the part where my family’s grave is you could see almost all the gravestones had been toppled over. “The gravestone I was looking for was actually one of the few left standing. “It was very upsetting, the state of the place was disgusting.” More than 100 graves vandalised in Flaybrick Cemetery Wirral council staff have been contacting relatives affected, though some of the graves are so old no living family members have been found. Last month a group of caring youngsters volunteered to help clean the cemetery, litter picking and clearing overgrown areas to allow staff to concentrate on the repairs to the graves themselves. Nic Harding, ranger and forest school leader for Wirral council, said at the time: “We’re still reeling from the fact this has been done. It’s a long, drawn-out process which will take several months to bring it back to how it was before. “The ones we can stand up we will, those that are too badly smashed will be laid out in their rightful place. “I expected that people would be distressed by the vandalism but I was really gladdened by these young people, so enthusiastically defending their heritage and willing to come and help.”   Follow @WirralNews What's on tonight?   Find things to do near you that you'll love Most Recent in News Wirral Council ‘Friends’ group handed keys to kennels News @wuthnhs colum 17/12/14 News Fire and Rescue Service column 17/12/14 Frank Field MP Column 17/12/14: Frank Field Esther McVey MP Column 17/12/14: Esther McVey Tranmere Rovers   All the latest news from Prenton Park BuySell   Buy & sell items including cars and houses, or browse thousands of ads.

The pair, driving a Subaru Impreza S11 WRC were triumphant lead from start to finish and were fastest on all six stages of the event. Speaking after the win Swann said: “Despite awful conditions from the start, we are delighted to win all six stages giving us our fourth victory on the rally in four years, “One win in Group N, One in B13 and two in WRC, I had a couple of stalls and one overshoot in the stages, but managed to maintain my lead all day. “The car ran well all day and I would like to thank my great team of mechanics who without I wouldn’t have achieved the win.” Dukeries Motor Club member Swann was 47 seconds ahead of second place crew of Arron Newby and Rob Fagg in another Subaru Impress WRC. Third place went to Dukeries Motor Club members Karl and Guy Simmons in rally sponsors SA Gas Subaru Impreza S11 WRC with 48 seconds separating them from the leading car and only a second from Newby and Fagg. Andrew Fenwick and Andrew Roughead finished fourth in another Impreza and top five place went to Gary Wayne and Neal Bloor in a non WRC Subaru Impreza. This was Wayne’s only second rally with co-driver Bloor. The event for its fourth year was ran entirely within Sherwood Pines Forestry as a single venue rally with six rally stages. It was organised by Dukeries Motor Club, with a mixture of modern rally cars supported by the historic rally cars of the 70s and 80s in their own rally. Speaking after the race Wayne said: “We had a really good day. We struggled with grip as I’m sure everyone did. “After a steady run through Stage One we had a few frights at Centre Parcs corner on stage 2 and we broke a drive shaft losing loads of time on Stage 4. “We completed the last stage in darkness without any spotlights, but remaining in fifth pace we were determined to get a top five place.” Other Duperies Motor Club members that made a top ten place were Dave Welch and Stuart Proctor’s Subaru Impress finishing in sixth position. Simon Belcher and Wayne Langthorne finished in 9th and 10th place went to John Tolson and co-driver Connor Toulson, both in Subaru Impreza’s. The Premier Historic Rally was won by Mansfield’s Paul Street and co-driven by Ian Jones in a Ford Escort Mk2, who were one minute one second ahead of Nottingham’s Chris Skill and Glenn Hall in a Ford Escort 1600 Sport. Third place honours went to Eastwood M/C members Barry Jordon and James Gratton-Smith in their Hillman Avenger. Street held onto the lead for most of the rally from the start with fastest times on all six stages. Fourth place went to York M/C’s Philip Thompson and Fred Roberts in an Escort Mark 1 RS2000. Mansfield’s Charlie Blaney and Adrian Wilford, of Clowne and Malton Motor Clubs, in an Escort MK2 Pinto finished sixth and claimed second in Class H2 Award. Other Dukeries Motor Club members that made the finish line included 13th placed Nigel Booley/Dave Catto, 19th placed Ashley Field/John Stevens, 20th placed Tony Szubert/Simon Szubert, 24th placed Dean Hickling/Geoff Moss, 25th placed Charlie Smith/Oliver Smith, 26th placed Ian Holliday/Peter Shaw, 30th placed Ramith Sarathchandra/Myles Kumar and Lee Sellars/Andy Hawkins, who came eighth in the Historic Rally.   Comments   Jobs Directory Property Motors Search for a job Keywords Location Search the directory Search For: (Plumber, Taxi, McDonalds...)

The festival will take place from Friday 22nd July until Sunday 24th July 2016 at Scone Palace, Perth, Scotland (www.scone-palace.co.uk).   As with the previous five Rewind Festivals at Scone Palace, this year’s Rewind extravaganza will provide an even bigger bang with the crème de la crème of classic 80’s pop music.   This year’s headline performances include the mesmerising Holly Johnson (Relax, Two Tribes) and Adam Ant (Stand and Deliver, Prince Charming). As with all past Rewind Festivals, the 80s celebrations will showcase non-stop music on the main stage from the biggest 80s icons, plus plenty of audience participation and plenty of nostalgic dressing up.   The festival includes an all-star 80s line-up featuring Rick Astley, ABC, Tony Hadley, Marc Almond, Go West, Roland Gift, China Crisis, Toyah, The Beat, Annabella’s Bow Wow Wow, plus many more big names, including legendary Scottish artists Midge Ure (Live Aid, Ultravox), The Bluebells, Average White Band and making their Rewind Scotland debuts, Living In A Box, Leo Sayer, Snap, and Slim Jim Phantom From Stray Cats.   One of the biggest highlights at this year’s festival is the Rewind Scotland debut of the British Electric Foundation. B.E.F. is the brainchild of Heaven 17’s Martyn Ware, and will showcase a unique and dazzling performance featuring a raft of legendary pop artists.   Ware has assembled a stellar line-up featuring the full Heaven 17 band performing songs made famous by the stars themselves, plus cover versions in the inimitable B.E.F. electronic pop style featuring Thomas Dolby, Black, Heaven 17’s Glenn Gregory, The Noisettes’ Shingai Shoniwa, Mari Wilson and The Farm’s Peter Hooton.   B.E.F.’s 80’s themed electronic extravaganza promises to be a hit-packed highlight of the entire weekend. Don’t dare miss it!   Tickets go on sale at 9am on Friday 29th January 2016. Full details about ticket outlets and prices are available from the official Rewind website: www.rewindfestival.com.   The festival will also feature plenty of additional non-stop festival fun from the Silent Disco to Live Karaoke Bar, as well as Camping and Glamping (aka Glamorous Camping) options. Additional festival necessities will be present, including a kidzone for the little ones, funfair, and a spectacular firework display to close the weekend. When Nature Calls wristbands will also be available giving festival goers access to posh loos.   Photo Credit: © Alan Rennie     All Dates 2016-07-24 00:00 July 2018 Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 26 May The Tannahill Weavers 17 Jun Daimh in Concert 24 Jul Rewind Scotland Scone William Shand Designs, 61 Albert Street, Dundee, DD4 6NZ Tel: 01382 459380"],

About us Theme Brake: It's time to reform renting Tim Pickstone writes…Help make the difference next Thursday Farron makes pitch to centre left voters – support Lib Dems for… Suzanne Fletcher wins Lifetime Achievement Award Advert Minority Rule: The power dynamic of social liberalism By Eden Watkins | Thu 24th March 2016 - 1:27 pm A few weeks ago now I started using a different name. First, I told my close friends and family about the change, then mentioned it in passing to acquaintances who asked how to address me, then I changed my Facebook, Twitter, email adress, all of my public facing profiles and simply began to expect people to use it as if it was the name I was baptised with. Yet curiously, even the most classically liberal of my classical liberal friends tolerated this action. Without consulting them, I made a decision about how they would use language, informed them of my choice and simply expected them to obey. Why did they accept this blatant disregard for their liberty to refer to me however they wish? This seems like a sarcastically ridiculous question, and it is. But don’t get me wrong I’m not trying to disparage classical liberalism, it is an honourable and consistent ideology; I agree with classical liberals that the government is a necessary evil we just disagree on how necessary an evil it is. My friends accepted that I wanted to be called something different because they know me and know I can call myself what I like. Calling me by my new name isn’t obeying a command, it’s respecting a person. Why do so many transgender celebrities not get granted the same courtesy? Why doesn’t the same principle apply to trigger warnings? Why are things different when someone asks you to remove a Facebook post because they think it’s deliberately abrasive? Because when these requests come from a faceless entity rather than a friend, it can look like minority rule. And here’s the challenging part: it is. I hope it’s not too much of a surprise to learn that I believe in democracy, though probably for rather unusual reasons. I don’t believe in democracy because it makes good decisions, In my experience any history book will tell you total democracy is as likely to give you a great leader or a tyrant as total monarchy is. Being elected into power gave us Franklin D. Roosevelt and Clement Attlee as well as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Being born into power gave us Catherine of Russia and Empress Theodora as well as Ivan the Terrible and David Cameron. I believe in democracy because at its best it neuters the tyranny of the minority and satiates the tyranny of the masses. In my mind, the perfect democratic state would be a huge bloated bureaucracy with no real leader or direction with politicians flying in and out of office so quickly they’re virtually incapable of doing anything except keeping the roads paved, the schools running and preventing any major crises. However in 2013 I watched my country’s small elitist government debate whether or not I should have the right to marry who I want, and in 2015 I watched the government of Slovenia host a referendum on whether or not Slovenians should be able to marry who they want. The minority rulers of my home country said yes, the people of Slovenia said no. It seems the great libertarian question of our time is how to balance freedom with security, from Edward Snowden to this week’s tragic terrorist attacks in Brussels. Perhaps the great democratic question of our time is how to balance what is popular with what is right. Maybe I’m obtuse for thinking my being able to marry who I want is a right rather than a privilege, maybe the majority of Slovenians holding that opinion means they should all be subjected to it. Or maybe we should see civil liberties and requests for courtesy like a friend asking to be called by a new name, maybe rather than demanding they justify their request to us, we should ask ourselves if we can justify denying them. * The author is a member of the Liberal Youth and a candidate for its executive committee Facebook Twitter Google Email Print Read more by Eden Watkins .

Eddie Sammon 24th Mar '16 - 2:05pm This is an incredibly thoughtful artical. I have questioned recently whether Liberal Democrats are getting the balance right between rights and what I called mandates, or what you might call privileges. We have a similar debate on whether to impose gay marriage on NI, like the US had recently with the Supreme Court and their states. A way to get around this is what I do with my republican views. I say I personally believe in having an elected head of state (or simply boosting the power of the Prime Minister), but I wouldn’t put it in a manifesto because it wouldn’t be popular yet. At its worst the debate between minority and majority rule, or rights versus mandates can lead to civil war, such as the English or Irish civil war. I’d like to know more about who has supreme power in our country because there are a few disputes that I think could get very messy if it isn’t clear who is actually in charge and there is also the question whether our constition is democratic and whether in certain circumstances the right of revolution should override it. Constitutions can be oppressive if they don’t get the balance right between rights of the majority versus the minority. Jennie 24th Mar '16 - 8:51pm Ahhhhh the tyranny of the majority. Like so much else it all goes back to Mill Manfarang 25th Mar '16 - 3:16am People change their names in Thailand, nothing much to do with democracy. Jayne Mansfield 25th Mar '16 - 9:20am It is all a bit above my head, Eden. I would call anyone by the name they wished to be called by. I see that as common courtesy. I don’t know what trials and tribulations ‘celebrities’ face. From what little I do know, don’t have much respect for any of them. What have they done to deserve filling up so called ‘newspapers’? My understanding of how a minority government reached it’s decision on gay marriage was because there was majority support for it. ( just look at some of the opinions expressed by the Boris Johnsons etc, before that became the case and they had one eye of electability. Once more, politicians whatever they like to claim, were behind the curve. Something can be popular and ( in my opinion) right. It is all a matter of persuasion. I believe in Democracy because it is the best form of bad government. No more, no less. Post a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

About us Theme Brake: It's time to reform renting Tim Pickstone writes…Help make the difference next Thursday Farron makes pitch to centre left voters – support Lib Dems for… Suzanne Fletcher wins Lifetime Achievement Award Advert Baroness Lindsay Northover writes…As time goes by By Lindsay Northover | Sun 6th March 2016 - 8:55 am At the Spring conference we will debate a topic which has spanned my whole political lifetime.  We will be debating a motion on increasing the diversity among our future MPs. In that election night in May 2015 we not only lost wonderful male MPs, we also lost all of our wonderful women MPs. One of the things we must do as we rebuild our Party is to ensure that we have a more diverse group of MPs.  Like the other major parties in Britain. I joined the SDP, new to politics, back in 1981.  I was excited by the new party, the realignment of politics – but especially its emphasis on women being as prominent in the party as men.  How could it not do so, with one leader being my beloved Shirley Williams?  Its equivalent of the Federal Executive was gender balanced – each region elected one man and one woman.  We were the first political party in the UK to insist that women must be included on parliamentary shortlists. I was selected from such a shortlist to fight Welwyn Hatfield in 1983 and 1987.  (The more winnable seats close by – Stevenage and St Albans – were of course fought by men.) And what we found, in 1983 and 1987, is that men were indeed securing the most winnable seats.  Having women on shortlists did not change things.  It did not change our parliamentary group. I did better than my male colleagues in terms of increasing my share of the vote – being a woman did not lose votes, but we weren’t in seats that won. At merger (I was on the negotiation committee), gender balance was a hotly debated topic – should we include the SDP’s affirmative action?  Hard fought for, we did, though it was weaker than in the SDP.  By this stage I was Chair of the Parliamentary Candidates Committee.  We had able women a-plenty in the organisation.  But they weren’t getting selected for our best seats.  Mentoring, training – that must be the key, people said.  All very helpful.  But it did not make the difference.  (I had done my PhD in the States and there I saw the positive action that got black students into universities, and the difference it made to their lives, and the USA.  It worked.) By the time of the 1992 election I was working full time, but now with two small children.  (I was struck when I was a Minister that the vast majority of my male counterparts had partners and children, whereas this was rarely true for my female colleagues. So much for equal opportunities.)  My main aim was to keep my head above water and not allow the Conference Committee, of which I was a member, to cancel the conference crèche because the party was in financial crisis as we were at 6% in the polls after the bloody battles of merger…. I produced another infant, this time a girl, appropriate under the circumstances as I was now Chair of Women Liberal Democrats (WLD).  Whereas my first infant had wailed through an FE meeting (my colleagues were fairly patient), this one aged 10 days wet Paddy Ashdown’s floor.  I escaped quickly, but hereby confess now. Now she and her brothers are adult.  Time has run on, but things have not changed. One of Paddy’s assistants, Claire, Conway, now Claire Wright, thought our party needed to be dragged into the modern era.  She was determined that we should change things.  And so was born the Campaign for Women, chaired by Sally Hamwee.  Backed by the leader, and some money, people worked their socks off with much training and mentoring. In the 1994 Euro elections, where I was vice chair of the campaign (put in there hurriedly when it was noticed that the whole election team was male), we realised that in our 10 potentially winnable seats, 8 had already selected men. So I with other members of WLD and the Campaign for Women called every single member in the next key Euro constituency selecting, and said you are selecting not just for this constituency, but for our national team.  There are able women on the shortlist, please consider a woman.  “Oh” they said, “I didn’t know.  Of course we will consider that.” No push-back at all, open-minded.  And an able young woman was selected. Needless to say we won only the top two seats – and two wonderful but completely male MEPs were duly elected.  Graham and Robin.  Our labour-intensive efforts had come to nought. And after a few years, the Campaign for Women was quietly abandoned – it merged with WLD. As we moved towards 1997, and Labour came up with the wonderful proposal of half their seats having women-only shortlists, and there was blood on their carpet, I envied the fact that they had managed to get that through. I then saw the difference the new Labour women made to the Commons.  They started to transform the place.  What is more, they brought change not only through better gender balance, but also a far wider diversity among all candidates – BAME, LGBT, those with disabilities.  And then they dragged the Tories after them.  The Tories, now way ahead of us in diversity. So when we had PR for Europe, and it was pointed out we could have zipping – one region headed by a woman, one by a man, and so on down the list, I was extremely keen that we did that.  There was great resistance, as well as key people who helped.  We had one lot of legal advice that said we couldn’t, but we went out and got legal advice from Cherie Booth, and she showed that we could.  And we did.  (Later the Equality Act of 2010 has made all of this not only easier, but opens us to legal challenge if we are not addressing equality in a more effective manner.  Bear that in mind.) The result in those Euro elections of 1999 was for me a total joy.  We elected 10 MEPs, five women, and five men. Finally we had broken through. So in the early 2000s, we had that debate at conference about all women shortlists for Westminster.  And on one side was Shirley Williams saying we simply must do this, saying she had fought for equal participation throughout her life, and it had not been achieved, here or round the world.  And on the other side was Jo Swinson, in a pink t-shirt, saying she was not going to be a token woman. When that motion went down, I along with many others felt distraught.  It certainly seemed a terrible lost opportunity.  And of course for our current 8 MPs, half were elected after this vote. And what people said was we need to mentor, train etc, and then we will change things.  And Jo found herself heading the new organisation, Campaign for Gender Balance.  And she and others worked their socks off, training, mentoring, and seeking to get women selected. But it did not change our party, and in due course the Campaign for Gender Balance merged with WLD to form Lib Dem Women, which was determined that we would finally break through…. And in the last Parliament, the Leadership Programme was set up, and people worked their socks off, training, mentoring, and getting women into seats where MPs were standing down. But after that, of course, most of the parliamentary party was swept away, and we have just eight white male MPs. So here am I, yet again.  I who joined a new party all those years ago partly because it stood for equal participation of both women and men, who stood for parliament hoping that I could make a difference, who then balanced full time work and three small children, and now see those three children grown up.   And when the tide was low in our party’s fortunes, because we had not made sure that at every level we had women candidates, we ended up with no women at all. Which is why the decision in Scotland that they are changing the way they will do things in the future – passed by 75:25 – makes me proud once again to be a Lib Dem. And I hugely commend Jo for her bravery in changing her mind, explaining why she now supports All Women Shortlists. Perhaps then I have should have some hope that finally, finally we will actually do something that helps to flatten that playing field and really ensure that it is merit that gets people elected.  After all it is clear that merit is simply not prevailing:  I am sure none in our party would maintain that half the population does not have that merit, or that BAME people don’t, or that LGBT people don’t, or that those with disabilities don’t.   And if we accept that merit alone is insufficient – and it surely can’t be if our Commons party is white men only – then we have to take action which makes the difference. I will wait until the vote has gone through conference, and then I tear down to London, and I will fly to New York, to attend as a British Parliamentarian the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women.  I hope that I will carry with me the wonderful warm glow that we have at last done something to improve the status of women and all those who have thus far been disadvantaged in the Lib Dems. * Lindsay Northover was Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for International Development, 2014-15, and is Liberal Democrats Spokesperson on International Development in the House of Lords.

Advert 48 Comments Simon McGrath 6th Mar '16 - 9:40am “And what we found, in 1983 and 1987, is that men were indeed securing the most winnable seats.” Happily though by 2015 things had changed and 60% of candidates in seats where an MP was retiring were women . david 6th Mar '16 - 9:52am And if this anti liberal motion gets through and our party approves positive discrimination I will be off. Member since 1979. Party chair at the moment. Won’t bore people with the arguments. Besides I am delivering and door knocking this afternoon. Havnt got the time. Funny – might be the last leaflets I will deliver. Mick Taylor 6th Mar '16 - 9:56am I hope we will finally agree action that does ensure we rectify this long standing wrong. I fear however that resistance to even this limited measure on AWS/ABAMES/ALGBTS will be voted down because it doesn’t tackle innate sexism or that it’s not ‘Liberal’ Please bear in mind the words of the philosopher John Rawls who said the only time discrimination is acceptable is when it helps the disadvantaged. Surely there is no clearer case for helping the disadvantaged than in ensuring that after so many years we finally take effective measures to ensure women, BAME and LGBT candidates get an equal chance to become our party’s national standard bearers. Mick Taylor 6th Mar '16 - 9:58am To David and others who threaten to leave, please consider that people like me who have spent a lifetime in the party campaigning for equality will be bitterly disappointed if this motion is not passed, but will – like a good Liberal – accept the decision and carry on. Caron Lindsay 6th Mar '16 - 10:10am I don’t think the debate is helped by threats to leave and I find it astonishing that people who have stuck with us through the last difficult years would up and off because we take measures that would be likely to achieve equality. I remember the dire warnings pre the 1998 Europe selections done under zipping, but, actually, what happened was that people did stick around and we elected a gender balanced team of parliamentarians. Woman1 6th Mar '16 - 10:38am The party will continue to hemorrhage hundreds of women (and men) to WE if the motion isn’t passed. We’ll still get leaflets out if we lose a couple of those who oppose equality. Caron Lindsay 6th Mar '16 - 10:43am I hope that we don’t lose anyone and that people see the compelling case for effective action – especially after the Scottish Party passed its motion so overwhelmingly last weekend. All the warnings of the roof falling in if we do something reminds me of all the scaremongering stuff about same sex marriage. What actually happened when we passed the law is that great happiness was caused and same sex couples got married. If we take evidence based action on equality, we give the best chance of electing a diverse range of MPs. Paul Holmes 6th Mar '16 - 11:18am But Lindsay, by 2015 we had already solved the ‘selection problem’ with for example 6 out of 11 retiring MP’s being replaced by female candidates. The only reason we did not elect our highest number of female MP’s ever was because the electorate comprehensively trashed our Party across the board in our worst election for a century and a half. So what is the problem that illiberal and divisive AWS measures are supposed to solve? Even back in 2001 when we last had this debate 23% of Approved Candidates were women and the same % of selected PPC’s were women -so there was no perceivable bias against selecting women then and a bias in favour of selecting women by 2015. Incidentally, I too joined the SDP (in 1983), I too balanced a full time job with raising three children, all now adults. I got selected and elected to Parliament in the seat where I had at that point lived, worked and raised a family for 22 years and campaigned for our Party for 18 years. I did not for one moment consider risking my job or uprooting my children from school and friends by rushing around the country looking for winnable seats I had no connection whatsoever with. Indeed in 1995 I was asked to put my name forward for a nearby winnable seat but declined saying I was committed to campaigning in my home area as the voluntary election organiser for another candidate. Instead we eventually won a seat which had previously returned unbroken, large, Labour majorities for 70 years and where, when I joined in 1983, we had zero Cllrs and had come third in every election since WW2. Given the dire state of our national electoral fortunes I strongly believe that those candidates who are most likely to win in 2020, whatever gender they are, are already known and working in their home constituency. Unlike Labour and the Conservatives we simply do not have Safe Seats, which have not changed hands for half a century or more and where selection is the same as automatic election. PR List systems such as for MEP’s are different and I would support Zipping 100% for those (assuming we remain in the EU!). Paul Holmes 6th Mar '16 - 11:25am PS – I meant Lindsay Northover not Caron Lindsay. Although I have expressed exactly the same thoughts before to my very good friend Caron Lindsay who used to campaign with us here before she moved back to Scotland. We simply disagree entirely about what the evidence shows. And I am still waiting for Caron to tell me if she thinks the new Scottish AWS rules should have been in place to prevent Willie Rennie or Charles Kennedy for example being selected when they were? Tony Greaves 6th Mar '16 - 12:00pm I hope that my good friend Lindsay and others who are obsessed with apparent equality to the exclusion of all the others things we believe in (democratic local choice etc) will also put in sufficient thought and energy into ensuring that we have any MPs at all after the next election. Tony Greaves david 6th Mar '16 - 12:59pm Oh Dear – I am not opposed to equality – how dare anybody infer that I am. I would have thought the PC brigade would have censored such comments. Precisely because I am for equality is exactly why I oppose the motion. And if it is passed – the party will have changed not me. I have stuck by the party because I agreed with it – up to now. Lorenzo Cherin 6th Mar '16 - 1:12pm David Look at what others , especially Caron, are saying, see the motives , not the mechanisms, we are all of us rooting for greater equality of opportunity. Simon Thorley 6th Mar '16 - 1:23pm @Caron My main concern (among others) is that the measures proposed will not achieve equality, but rather exacerbate inequality. The key determinants of any individual’s life success remain parental income and education level, not gender, sexual identity or (to a lesser extent) race. There is no commitment with the proposals to control for these variables, apparently because ‘social background’ is not a protected characteristic (which is true). This doesn’t mean we can’t control for these variables – it’s just an excuse not to. If we end up with 50% women elected, but with those women being of the same social background of the men they have ‘replaced’, we have achieved no greater diversity. The proposals consider only ‘visible’ markers of difference – which assumes commonalities of experience, expertise and opinion between all women (for example) that simply don’t exist. Using crude aggregations, rather than focusing on each individual’s life experiences, is both illiberal and counter-productive. John Barrett 6th Mar '16 - 1:37pm The trouble is not that those apposing the current proposals are against change or improving the existing the system. What many opposing the current motion are saying is that the current proposals, including AWS, will simply not deliver what its supporters think it will. Lindsay may have been impressed by the positive impact of AWS when introduced by the Labour Party. I have very different memories from my time in the Commons. But don’t take my word for it. This is what the Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews has said of that time. “Analysis of the vote against the Iraq War reveals an unhappy lack of support among women Labour back-benchers. In a long and hard-fought debate, four Labour women spoke against the war (Diane Abbott, Glenda Jackson, Alice Mahon and Lynne Jones). From 139 Labour MPs who voted against the war, just 15 were women. However, it is equally necessary to say that the vast influx of young women that attended upon the 1997 General Election, and the steadily incremental increase in their numbers as of result of women-only shortlists (involving the concomitant rejection of men of character and ability), has not fulfilled Emily’s hopes. Interesting studies into dissidence among the Parliamentary Labour Party in 2005-6 reveal uncomfortable facts for the proponents of Emily’s List. During this important period, the Government embarked on a programme of legislation aimed at restricting personal and civil liberty, and parliamentary battles and dissent were commonplace. On at least one occasion, 106 Labour MPs voted against their Whip. Of these only 20 were women and just four had been elected in 2005.” I would be delighted to be given the opportunity to select an able female candidate as a PPCs and then to help them get elected to Parliament, but not by saying that we have to stop good males from applying for the same seats. I would also have serious concern if the candidates I have to choose from have only been prepared to come forward after they have found out there will be no men applying for the same seat. Living in a seat with a good prospect of the party regaining it and which will now use an AWS, this will not necessarily fill the membership and activists or even voters, with the confidence they need in order to support the party again Catherine Jane Crosland 6th Mar '16 - 2:25pm It is so sad to see so much division and unhappiness in the party over this issue. Especially sad because most of those on both sides of this debate passionately want the same thing – greater equality and diversity. The only difference is in their views on how to achieve this. I do feel that we need to focus on tackling sexism within the party, and also looking at the many complex reasons why so few women are putting themselves forward as candidates. One reason may be because many women believe sexism within the party means they would be wasting their time putting themselves forward. But an equally strong reason is likely to be that being a parliamentary candidate is not family friendly, and being an MP is still less so. It’s true this is not just a problem for women – I’m sure many men with young children are put off becoming candidates for this reason too. Another factor is that, for a whole number of reasons, (and this is just a generalisation), women do just seem to be more likely to lack confidence and to underestimate their abilities, and for this reason are likely not to even consider putting themselves forward as candidates unless encouraged to do so. I do feel that we need to be looking at ways of tackling all these factors, rather than opting for the divisive solution of All Women Shortlists, which is not really a solution. Mick Taylor 6th Mar '16 - 3:21pm We would not need to do anything about ensuring that women, BAME and LGBT candidates are selected in seats with a prospect of winning, except for the fact that the selectorate in those (and in fact almost all) seats do not choose people who are not pale and male unless another candidate is unbelievably better and often not even then. This is because there is an abiding myth amongst many in our party -contrary to evidence – that non pale male candidates get less votes. Now many of those who oppose AWS do so because they believe we have to change the sexist behavior in the party and that AWS won’t do that. The truth is that nothing we have done to change behavior and attitudes has worked. It has come to the point where in order to achieve the desired end of making our parliamentarians more representative of the country at large we have to try methods that we don’t especially like, but which academic evidence has shown to work. [And in case some of you have short memories, we have used discrimination in this way before, when we applied zipping in 1999 for the European elections – with great success. It is also worth pointing out that on that occasion it wasn’t just pale white men who lost out, but at least two women, who although topping the members’ ballot went in as number 2 on their list] Those opposing the very limited change to our rules seem to have great concern for the small number of men who might lose out, but very little for the many women who have faced and continue to face very real discrimination in our party. Countless women that I know who have applied for winnable seats and who have not been selected, despite in one case the winning candidate being allowed to break the rules and in another a complete outsider being parachuted in. No, what’s being proposed is what some of us had hoped wouldn’t be necessary, but now is, unless we want to continue as we are. paul barker 6th Mar '16 - 3:53pm Currently my local Rail/Overground station is being rebuilt, causing me some minor disruption as the entrance keeps being moved from from one place to another. Part of the rebild involves the installation of Lifts which I dont, currently need. Are Transport For London disciminating against able-bodied people without young children ? No, they are discriminating in favour of the disabled, frail & those with young chilren who found the stairs a big problem. Any disruption to my life is incidental & I would feel pretty Illiberal if I complained. Sesenco 6th Mar '16 - 5:57pm Baroness Northover’s potted history has brought back a memory. I joined the SDP at around the same time, and one of the first events that I attended was a Parliamentary hustings where I then lived. One of the women was selected (she looked extremely good on paper and knew how to talk). Then I had a look at the transfers. It was clear that about half of the membership was voting for the women only, and the other half was switching between the men and the women. I imagined myself in Northern Ireland, where you vote either Protestant or Catholic, except that in this case only one side was voting on a tribal basis. This gender partisanship which we see today was alive and kicking all those years ago. Tribal politics in yet another guise. An observation. Almost all the women who voted in that selection were middle-class. Funnily enough, I have never witnessed working-class women behave in that way. Yet those women who suffer from discrimination in this country are overwhelmingly working-class. What about single parents living on benefits in mini Pruitt-Igoes? What about the very many women who work for next to nothing and with zero job security in the catering industry, or in care homes, or hotels? Women have moved into the higher ranks over the last forty years such that they are now competing with men on a fair basis. My workplace is stuffed full of female managers. It is working-class women who are losing out. What is Baroness Northover’s message for them? An even older memory comes back. Girls running round the playground bawling out: “Girls are the best!” Catherine Jane Crosland 6th Mar '16 - 6:03pm Paul Barker, in all fairness the situation with your train station would only be a true analogy for all women shortlists if you were yourself banned from using the station. elwyn watkins 6th Mar '16 - 6:30pm This debate reminds me of the SDP/Liberal negotiations over who should fight target seats in the 1980s. There was little debate over existing MPs and there was little debate over hopeless seats. But where there was an existing credible local challenger who the local Party supported, it caused much friction. You cannot win in a marginal seat by automatically excluding a popular candidate that the local Party supports. Peter Davies 6th Mar '16 - 7:37pm In the process of getting more women elected to parliament, there appears to be only one part which is not broken: the selection of candidates. We don’t get enough women to become activists. We don’t get enough female activists to become approved candidates. we don’t get enough of those approved to apply for winnable seats. We do tend to select those who apply and then we fail to get them elected. We need to fix all the stages where we are failing (especially the last one) rather than pretending that it’s all down to the ordinary members failing to select women. Paul Holmes 6th Mar '16 - 8:16pm @Mick Taylor. Mick you have been asked this a number of times over the last week or two and you just ignore it as have 2 or 3 other advocates of AWS on the same point. Where is the evidence for your claim of bias against selecting women? In 2001/2005 women were selected in more or less exact ratio to the numbers in which they applied. The same applied overall in 2015 but in our Target Seats they were selected in greater numbers and in the 11 seats where MP’s were standing down they were selected at a ratio twice as high as their numbers on the Approved Candidates List. There is simply no evidence for your repeated claim of discrimination against selecting women. So what is the purpose of AWS? What problem is it seeking to fix? At least the more draconian system adopted in Scotland is honest -there they basically want every winnable seat to have a compulsory female candidate. But that ignores entirely what makes a seat ‘winnable’ for the Lib Dems -especially in the electoral climate we are now in. Does parachuting an outside candidate in, over the heads of a well known local candidate who has the ‘wrong’ gender mean we will win the seat? On the basis of what -our amazingly good national image and opinion poll ratings? David Raw 6th Mar '16 - 8:32pm Might be worth remembering the quote from that late great feminist, Eleanor Roosevelt (wife of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt) : “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.” My other thought is that a certain member of the House of Lords (and those who supported him last year) did nothing but damage to the Party’s appeal to able women candidates. Flo Clucas 6th Mar '16 - 10:30pm Thank you for your openness, Lindsay. I recall so many of the events you have chronicled and am saddened that so little has changed. Those who disagree with affirmative action write of there being no evidence to support the case for it. On the contrary, there is much evidence. Research across Europe and indeed the rest of the world shows that selectors vote for people like themselves. These ‘gatekeepers’ – in politics they are primarily male – are very important in the process, as they influence others too. The issue of women being selected for winnable seats in 2015 has been raised. In the context of our opinion polling from 2010 onwards, it was obvious that many of those seats were at risk and that as a result, women would not be elected. If our party is serious about electoral equality for women, it has to recognise that the status quo is not an option. We know that affirmative action works. The zipping process in European elections proved it was workable and that it made a difference. We need to address discrimination and lack of diversity within selection processes. Taking no action, keeping the status quo, is no longer acceptable. Peter Davies 7th Mar '16 - 7:39am There are three levels of ‘gatekeeper’ in the Lib Dems: The members are the proper people to choose candidates and though a majority are men, there is every indication that they are as keen to get women elected as those who would disenfranchise them. The selection committees exist to reduce the choice given to the members. They should be abolished but they are already required to short-list at least one third women. The approvals system is an area where affirmative action is reasonable. We should ensure there are enough female approved candidates for every seat. This is not the cause of the problem though. Any women who fall at this stage are probably missing out on a paper candidacy. Rob 7th Mar '16 - 7:58am I have been a member since 1972 and so will not be leaving if this goes through. I simply won’t take part, practically or financially, in any local party selection process that involves contrived single gender short lists. Val Keitch 7th Mar '16 - 9:49am This is the most Illiberal motion .Yes we need more women in Parliament , however I would be happy to see more Lib Dem MPs full stop . Positive discrimination is a 1960’s notion and should be consigned to that era . I agree with Tony Greaves let’s concentrate on getting more Lib Dems elected locally and nationally .I find the part of the conference motion that suggests all women short lists may be imposed on some target constituencies very worrying . There are many minority groups under represented ,we could end up with all whatever lists . It must be the best fit for each constituency surely regardless of gender,sexual orientation or ethnicity . I started working for the old Liberal Party in 1973 ,and was attracted because of its inclusive nature ,please don’t change that for the sake of political correctness. David Evans 7th Mar '16 - 10:20am Flo, You mention evidence in Europe about affirmative action. How much of this was in a First Past the Post system where the party carrying it out was on the edge of a oblivion? If there is some please let us know about it. Otherwise I suggest that we need to stick to the real problem, which is simply that so many people stopped trusting us after we let them down badly in coalition. We need more Lib Dems who have worked hard for years to build a local presence to withstand and fight back against the tide, if they are women like Jo Swinson or Sarah Teather great. If they are men, equally great. However, we need them now and banning someone from standing in a constituency where they have worked for years just because that person is not a woman will only make our failure more certain. I’m a Lib Dem because I want more Lib Dems to win everywhere, not because I want to prevent some Lib Dems being given what could easily be our very last chance. Simon Shaw 7th Mar '16 - 10:54am @Flo Clucas “We know that affirmative action works. The zipping process in European elections proved it was workable and that it made a difference.” That’s not really a very good argument, Flo. In the European election we have the closed list system of PR, in constituencies of millions of voters, where voters vote for the party rather than the individual and most voters have absolutely no idea who their candidates or sitting Euro-MPs are. For example if someone as manifestly unsuitable to be a Euro-MP as me (or my female equivalent) had been at or near the top of the NW Euro-constituency in the past then we would have won exactly the same number of seats. In contrast, parliamentary elections are by FPTP, constitituencies have tens of thousands of voters (not millions) and a lot more voters vote for “the person”, rather than the party. In many cases AWS will end up with the best candidate, with the best chance of winning, being selected as PPC in a given constituency. But logic suggests that in some cases a sub-optimal candidate will be selected. That carries the very real prospect that a seat that we could have won/retained, will be lost. But, hey!, the “status quo is not an option” even if it means we end up with even fewer MPs. Helen Tedcastle 7th Mar '16 - 1:19pm I am against the idea of imposing AWS on constituencies. In fact I would oppose any attempt at imposing group-identity shortlists full stop. It is illiberal simply to be put forward ‘as something’ and to be selected because that person fits a category approved by the party at a given point in time. I believe in selecting people on their merit whether male or female. AWS seems like a quick fix so we can be seen to be doing something. This is not real equality but window-dressing. Ben Jephcott 7th Mar '16 - 1:56pm I will be looking very hard at any amendments to this motion but as it stands I do not think it strikes the right balance and must be opposed. The supporters seem to represent a collective loss of patience with other approaches to incrementally increasing equality and diversity in the party. But the statistic that 60 per cent of candidates to succeed retiring MPs were women is crucial – in a more typical election result there would have been a significant movement in the right direction. Sadie Smith 7th Mar '16 - 2:01pm I hope Lindsay gets her wish and that the Party changes. I fear it will still witter on about training and how good 2015 was. There are people women candidates can reach. It is past time that the Party hanged. Sadie Smith 7th Mar '16 - 2:02pm Oops changed! Paul Murray 7th Mar '16 - 2:19pm Based on the very useful statistics on candidates for 2015 provided by Paul Holmes I can only agree with the widely expressed view that the issue in 2015 was not the gender of the candidates, it was the fact that they were wearing a yellow rosette. I have thought back over the general election candidates for whom I have campaigned since my first GE in 1987 and it stands at 3 men and 3 women (I was living abroad in 1997). What I would observe is that not a single one of those 6 was what anyone could by the wildest stretch of the imagination describe as “working class”. If there is a diversity issue in this party, that’s where it really lies. John Barrett 7th Mar '16 - 2:53pm Paul Murray – how true. The problem with that issue is that almost nobody can see that there is a problem at all. Sue S 7th Mar '16 - 3:44pm I am so glad that Flo Clucas mentioned gatekeepers as I am getting bored with talking about hidden bias and how it works against women with absolutely no acknowledgement from those who are against AWS, seeing it as illiberal. Of course we should be taking action to help minority groups as well and people from different backgrounds. In my view the party was led astray not just by the men at the top but by the fact that several of those men were from an extremely privileged background and seemed too easily drawn into the Tory club and impressed by the grandeur of their new positions. Until you recognise the existence of hidden bias, selecting in your own image, marking down female students, men interrupting women in a discussion and other issues it is easy to see preventing a handful of men from standing in a couple of winnable seats as illiberal in a knee jerk reaction. Jo Swinson put her faith in the liberalism of the party but has now changed her mind. I remember feeling very sad that she disagreed with AWS as did quite a few other younger women who I believe did not understand the nature of discrimination. It is extremely difficult to judge a woman’s ability fairly when she does not look and sound like the other candidates, or a predecessor. To all those who disagree with AWS I would just say: we’ve tried everything else and it hasn’t worked, let’s test out this option and if it works we will all be relieved. If it doesn’t then we will try to find another way or all pack up and go home because it has become impossible for the Liberal party to achieve Liberal outcomes, which it must do to survive. Helen Tedcastle 7th Mar '16 - 3:53pm Sue S In response to your comment: ‘ To all those who disagree with AWS I would just say: we’ve tried everything else and it hasn’t worked…’ I think Paul Holmes puts the actual situation we are in in some perspective: ‘… by 2015 we had already solved the ‘selection problem’ with for example 6 out of 11 retiring MP’s being replaced by female candidates. The only reason we did not elect our highest number of female MPs ever was because the electorate comprehensively trashed our Party across the board in our worst election for a century and a half.’ Liz Leffman 7th Mar '16 - 7:48pm When we were in government, we did an amazing job (or at any rate Vince Cable did) of changing the face business, by making it clear that he expected that FTSE 100 Boards should include at least 25% women, with the threat of quotas in the background. During the last parliament, the number of women on those boards doubled and there was also a significant increase in the number of women on FTSE 250 boards too. Are we saying this was “illiberal”? And if not, and it was OK for us to require business to take equality seriously, why isn’t it OK for us s a party to do so? Why do we have to slog on for ever with a bit of training and mentoring here and there, hoping that next time it will work, when businesses are steaming ahead? Are there hordes of men out there who are resentful because women have taken their board positions? Funnily enough, no! Flo Clucas 8th Mar '16 - 7:19am For David and Simon, who have asked where the evidence is: The European Institute for Gender Equality reports on systems within Europe demonstrates that for those parties that have a self imposed target for selection, not only do they elect more women, but more men too. Finland is a classic example. The Opcit report for the European Parliament which has just been published did likewise. The EIGE are all available in English. The UN has also published relevant data. As for zipping, of course it worked. We ended up with more female MEPs. The party chose to zip candidates. If it hadn’t, voted for that affirmative action mechanism, we would have had very many fewer female MEPs elected. Incidentalky, if you read the New Staesman from 2011 (The Staggers) the article predicts exactly what hapoened in the 2015 election to our then female MPs and prospective candidates in ‘winnable’ seats. Flo Clucas 8th Mar '16 - 7:22am Apologies, for the odd spelling mistake. My ipad isn’t behaving well this morning. David Evans 8th Mar '16 - 8:57am Flo, thanks for your response, but it doesn’t answer the question Simon and I asked. Our question was simple, is there any evidence produced from FPTP electoral systems with a struggling minor party adopting it. If not, the evidence you are relying on is is sadly irrelevant. I realise that there is lots of evidence relating to continental systems with some form of PR, but even there in many cases the metrics they have chosen to use look rather flakey to me. However that is no use to us at all in the situation we find ourselves on the edge of a precipice. Flo Clucas 8th Mar '16 - 7:57pm Hi David, You might want to read the Fawcett Society booklet on electoral systems and women’s electoral opportunities. It makes reference to changes in Spain’s political parties,, which have seen more women elected. It also looks at the issue of systems and women’s electoral chances and argues rightly that systems alone don’t make a difference. What does, is the approach to affirmative action within parties initially that gives many women a real chance of being selected in a winnable position. Mick Taylor 8th Mar '16 - 8:57pm Simon Shaw. Sub optimal candidates are selected all the time – and currently nearly all of them are pale white men. Are you seriously suggesting that by selecting women candidates in a few more cases than now we will have more sub optimal candidates? Why not look at the academic research. It shows that this is just one more myth about AWS and in fact the candidates selected by AWS are at least as good as those selected in any other way and in many cases are actually better. You may not like the idea of AWS, but at least don’t peddle myths. Paul Holmes 8th Mar '16 - 9:00pm Flo, When I was an MP I remember taking part in a TV debate where I argued in favour of multi member STV electoral divisions at all levels because: a) They were more democratic b) In New Zealand when they moved that way from the FPTP system we bequeathed them it led more or less immediately to an increase in the ratios of women and Indigenous Peoples (Maori and South Sea Islanders) being elected. I want more diversity in society and in elected representatives. I have two daughters -one of whom has been a LD Cllr like her mother and one of whom had more sense! The question is how we best achieve it under primarily FPTP elections. Or for that matter under PR elections when our Party is at such a low ebb in public esteem following the destruction wrought by 2010-2015. Mick Taylor 8th Mar '16 - 9:01pm David Evans. Really your argument won’t wash. All the research shows that by selecting more representative candidates the party is likely to gain rather than lose seats. If you are suggesting that some men will lose out (and I am a pale white man) then it’s nothing compared to the huge injustice that women have faced as long as I have been a party member [joined at 14 in 1964] The idea that we might not select the best candidate is deeply insulting to any woman seeking selection and you really ought to row back from where your comments lead. Simon Shaw 8th Mar '16 - 10:25pm @Mick Taylor “Simon Shaw. Sub optimal candidates are selected all the time – and currently nearly all of them are pale white men. Are you seriously suggesting that by selecting women candidates in a few more cases than now we will have more sub optimal candidates?” Really? Firstly you will have noted that I was specifically talking about winnable seats. Accordingly would you be good enough to give me a few examples of these pale white men that we had standing in held or winnable seats in 2015 who you regard as sub-optimal. Secondly, I’m not suggesting that by selecting women candidates in a few more cases than now we will have more sub optimal candidates. I believe that, with or without AWS we will select more women candidates next time. All those women who would have been selected without AWS are, by definition, the optimal candidate, always assuming that the selection process is fair – and I’ve not seen anyone produce any evidence that it isn’t. However if a certain class of possible candidates are excluded from consideration, and if the optimum candidate happens to be within that excluded group, then obviously the finally chosen PPC will be sub-optimal. Isn’t that obvious? “Why not look at the academic research. It shows that this is just one more myth about AWS and in fact the candidates selected by AWS are at least as good as those selected in any other way and in many cases are actually better.” I think you must have misread the research as what you say there is lacking in logic. If you really believed in what you are saying then surely you would argue that ALL our PPCs should be women as it would mean that we would win more seats than otherwise – which is what I am concerned with. Simon Shaw 8th Mar '16 - 10:40pm @Mick Taylor All the research shows that by selecting more representative candidates the party is likely to gain rather than lose seats. Any chance you could provide a link to all this research (or even any of it)? “If you are suggesting that some men will lose out (and I am a pale white man) then it’s nothing compared to the huge injustice that women have faced as long as I have been a party member” I can’t speak fot David, but personally I don’t give a fig for the idea that some men will lose out. What matters to me is whether Course of action A will lead to more Lib Dem MPs than Course of action B (always so long as the system doesn’t discriminate against women or minorities). When you refer to “the huge injustice that women have faced as long as I have been a party member” you imply that there is some sort of institutional sexism. Talking about the last (say) 10 years could you possibly spell out what form this institutional sexism takes? “The idea that we might not select the best candidate is deeply insulting to any woman seeking selection” I reckon that under the current system all the women selected have been been the best candidate for their particular constituency and similarly for all the men (certainly if you are talking about our winnable constituencies). Stuart 8th Mar '16 - 10:54pm @Helen Tedcastle “I believe in selecting people on their merit whether male or female.” The trouble is though that there is plenty of evidence this does not happen at the moment, not just in your party but generally in society. That’s why those who favour AWS see it as something worth trying to “recalibrate” the system, in conjunction with other methods of course. Those who complain that AWS is “illiberal” cut no ice with me, because the only real alternative on offer seems to be to continue tolerating the tacit bias against women that most of us believe exists, and that would be even more illiberal. The only problem with the proposals is that they are far too modest, and as such are likely to achieve little. I saw someone the other day liken the strategy to that used by Trudeau in Canada, which isn’t very inspiring seeing as the Canadian Liberals have very low numbers of women compared to other parties, but at least it’s a step in the right direction. As an outsider, I find the attitude of the opponents to AWS in your party pretty lamentable. It seems to me that anti-AWS Lib Dems have had things 100% their own way for decades with no progress being made. Now they are only going to have things 95% their own way, the rancour on display seems completely out of proportion to what may actually happen. Post a Comment Click here to cancel reply.

King will be replaced by Mike Coupe, the retailer's current commercial director on 9 July, the day the company holds its annual general meeting. The BBC's business editor, Robert Peston, tweeted the news of King's impending departure saying: \"Possibly the most long-running rumoured departure in corporate history is finally happening: Justin King to quit Sainsbury.\" Peston also suggested that King's move was \"probably wise\" given he was recently voted the UK's most admired chief executive. There is \"only one direction from the top\", added Peston. In a statement posted on the supermarket's website, King said: \"This was not an easy decision for me to make, and in truth it will never feel like the right time to leave a company like Sainsbury's.\" Since joining the supermarket from Marks and Spencer in 2004, King has enjoyed notable success. His ten years at the helm have seen the supermarket gain an extra ten million customers a week. The company is growing - albeit much more slowly in recent times Peston writes on his blog. News of King's departure triggered a three per cent drop in the company's shares. It is not known what King's next step will be. The company's chairman, David Tyler said: \"Justin is a truly exceptional leader, who has reshaped Sainsbury's during his 10 years as CEO.\" Sign up for our daily newsletter Close Sign me up Have you seen our brand new magazine for children?

Share: Left-arm spinner Paul White took 6-82 and seamer Ben Humpage 4-94 as Division 2 leaders Abingdon Vale bowled out Tiddington for 219. Tiddington's South African Riaan Krynauw was in the runs yet again, top-scoring with 77, while John Mackie hit a useful 46. Vale had 51 overs to attempt the run chase, but only Tom Pollard (31) prospered against some tight Tiddington bowling, which left the visitors clinging on for a draw on 170-9. Tiddington 18pts, Abingdon Vale 17. Nitin Sehgal hit a fine 104 as Morris Motors Exiles played out a tense high scoring draw with second-placed Bourton Vale. The Exiles scored a competitive 249 all out against some good bowling by Nick Anderson (4-55) and Graham Newhook 3-66. Nawaz Mucadam then struck 108 for Vale, but with Abhay Mayer taking 5-96 they fell just two runs short on 247-6. Exiles were docked one point for their slow over rate. Morris Motors Exiles 15, Bourton Vale 20. Horspath thrashed Challow & Childrey by 104 runs to maintain pressure on the top two. Ned Murray (81no), Phil Chanel (45) and Will Eason (45) took Horspath to 218-7, before Dean Creed (4-20) and Mohsin Rana (3-28) reduced Challow to 60-8. Laurence Houghton (34no) then led a ninth-wicket stand of 50, but he ran out of partners when his team was all out for 114. Challow & Childrey 11, Horspath 30. Chris Welsh took 6-32 and then hit an unbeaten 62 as Bledlow Ridge secured their first win and Oxford 2nd suffered their first defeat. After they chose to bat, Oxford were skittled for 114 despite 60 not out from Tim Marcon. Thanks to Welsh, Ridge reached victory for the loss of just three wickets. Bledlow Ridge 30, Oxford 2nd 7. Kingston Bagpuize stay rooted to the bottom after they were on the receiving end of some ferocious hitting from Leighton Buzzard Town. Tom Scott hit 119 and Phil Whatmore 101 from 76 balls as Town piled on 304-4 before declaring three overs early. Only Marco Cecchini could find any form against spinners Antony Francis (3-38) and Lee Selfe (3-39) and was stranded on 54 when the rest of his side were all out for 141 in the 36 over.

A number of engineers from the building also marked four decades since they began their apprenticeship with the nuclear management partners’ company. Tony Roberts, Steve Grimshaw, Ian McMurran and Rob Millington began as British Nuclear Fuels plc apprentices in 1974 and have remained with the company working in the engineering capability since. Mr Roberts said: “When I first moved into Hinton House it was completely different to what it is today - the offices were full of drawing boards instead of computers, in the design offices everyone had a drawing board unless you were a senior manager and communication was primarily by telephone and the post, no emails.” The company also welcomed six young people to the team on September 1 who will undergo a four year design engineering apprentice scheme.

Share Share Tweet +1 Email Residents and traders in Kings Heath are delighted after plans to convert a historic cinema into a 700-seat restaurant and wedding banquet suite were thrown out by city planners. Locals had feared gridlock to the already busy Kings Heath High Street if the plans to convert the derelict Kingsway Cinema into a Chinese restaurant were approved. But the planning committee voted unanimously to refuse the restaurant because there is a severe lack of off street parking in the shopping centre and it would add to already lengthy traffic queues. The plans stated that a ground floor restaurant would provide 300 covers, while conference and function room on a newly created first floor would cater for 400 guests. Planning officer Victoria Bennett said: “This proposal would cause harm to the free and safe flow of traffic along the highway and would result in on street parking in nearby residential areas.” Councillor Emily Cox (Lib Dem, Moseley and Kings Heath) welcomed the decision and added that they hope to find a better viable use for the building. She said: “There is simply nowhere for 300 restaurant guests to park on a High Street which is already heavily congested. “Residents and the people who use Kings Heath shopping will be delighted the traffic will not get any worse.” But she added that residents and councillors were keen to see the building restored and reused. It has been suggested that a pub or music venue would not attract so many cars as there are more drinkers and less drivers. Conservationists have also called for the art-deco cinema, designed and built by architect Horace G Bradley during the first great wave of cinema building in Britain, to be listed and protected. It was, in March this year, added to the city council’s top list of historically significant buildings. But this is only an advisory rating and only Government listing would protect the Kingsway from demolition or serious alteration. The Conservation and Heritage Panel described the cinema as ‘stunning’.   Follow @birminghampost @@neilelkes Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Most Read in News Labour Party Library of Birmingham cuts are an embarrassment, writers claim Solihull Mandy Rice-Davies dies aged 70 Birmingham City Council Birmingham biking boost as Raleigh chosen to supply 5,000 cycles Birmingham City Council Major Birmingham funding cuts confirmed as urban areas hit hardest Birmingham city centre Photo archive of inner-city Birmingham revealed 50 years on Find a local business   Search for businesses in your area Most Recent Post People Eastside's Millennium Point Trust launches Young Innovator Prize initiative Labour Party Library of Birmingham cuts are an embarrassment, writers claim Birmingham City Council Birmingham biking boost as Raleigh chosen to supply 5,000 cycles Hidden Spaces Birmingham's Hidden Spaces: Inside reborn Grand Hotel Birmingham City Council Major Birmingham funding cuts confirmed as urban areas hit hardest BuySell   Buy & sell items including cars and houses, or browse thousands of ads What's On tonight   Find things to do near you that you'll love Most read on Birmingham Post Creative Birmingham's Hidden Spaces: Photos reveal former Odeon cinema lost to time Kings Heath Planners back new life for Kingsway building Paradise Circus Road to 'Paradise' mapped out as 11 years of building begins Hidden Spaces Birmingham's Hidden Spaces: Inside reborn Grand Hotel Labour Party Library of Birmingham cuts are an embarrassment, writers claim Follow Us Contact Us Send A Story Advertise The Editor Journalists Join us on social media.

While preparing for the interview, I read through his timeline for the engine's development, which is published on his website. Amid all the technical jargon and details of publisher deals was the simple line \"Finally added SLOPES!\" It stood out because whereas so much of the information was factual and to the point, this entry conveyed more emotion; a strong sense of both relief and achievement. I asked him what the big deal was, and he responded thus: Read more Tags dark souls ii, duke nukem 3d, elite: dangerous, total war rome ii, unreal engine 4, watch dogs « Previous 1 Next » Authors Joe Martin (126) Podcast (95) Richard Swinburne (80) Antony Leather (73) Alex Watson (55) Clive Webster (43) Mark Mackay (27) Paul Goodhead (25) Tim Smalley (21) David Hing (20) Archives December 2015 (1) July 2015 (1) June 2015 (1) May 2015 (1) April 2015 (1) January 2015 (1) November 2014 (2) September 2014 (2) July 2014 (2) June 2014 (2) May 2014 (2) April 2014 (2) Links Blog RSS Feed Podcast RSS Feed Thermaltake UK Modding Trophy powered by Scan Final Voting They're all in!

Three men have been jailed for a total of 18 years in connection with the manslaughter of a man who was chased through the streets of Bexley and fatally stabbed. Olamide Fasina, from Erith, was attacked by an armed gang near Wolvercote Road on the Thamesmead estate on Tuesday, October 14 last year. The 25-year-old was eventually cornered and stabbed through the heart. He was dead shortly afterwards, despite the efforts of paramedics to save him. Police were called by people who had heard Mr Fasina, also known as Ben, trying to escape. Louis Henry, Alvin Ansah-Baaphy and Steven Ngolo were convicted following a trial at the Old Bailey last Thursday and sentenced yesterday. Henry, 22, of Henwick Road, Eltham, was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter. Ansah-Baaphy, 23, of Old Dover Road, Abbey Wood, and Ngolo, 22, of Portmeadow Walk, Abbey Wood, were both jailed for three years for conspiracy to cause actual bodily harm. The court heard that drug-dealer Ngolo had called from his cell in Thameside Prison to urge the other defendants to take revenge on Olamide for an earlier incident. Investigating officer Detective Inspector Tony Lynes said: “These sentences have come following a difficult and challenging police inquiry. “Olamide was fatally attacked last October as a result of what was in effect a dispute between young men. “The senseless attack on him was all the more shocking because it took place in the afternoon in a highly populated estate, with many people around who witnessed a very violent altercation. “I would like to pay tribute to Olamide’s family, who have been left devastated by the loss of their son but have been extremely supportive of the inquiry.” Keywords: Erith Abbey Wood UN Court Tweet Share Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. 0 comments Comments Welcome , please leave your message below.

Share Share Tweet +1 Email Matillion managing director Matthew Scullion Fast-growing IT firm Matillion is on target to hit revenues of £1m following demand for its cloud-based business intelligence software. The Knutsford-based company said it is experiencing high demand for Matillion BI, which is currently being used by clients including Character World in Cheadle, toy manufacturer Sambro in Bury, Zebra Finance in Stoke, and the Real Good Food Company in Liverpool. Matillion is now set on international growth plans, with 10 per cent of revenues already coming from overseas customers and expects this to grow to 25 per cent in 2015. The firm was launched in 2011 by entrepreneur and managing director Matthew Scullion, who saw an opportunity to deliver cloud-based software specialising in the area of business intelligence, analytics and ‘big data’. The company developed ‘Matillion BI’ to offer businesses affordable business intelligence and analytics software. It helps firms to easily generate analysis and reports such as sales, pricing, finance, supply chain, manufacturing and operations. Matthew said: “We identified a gap in the market and spent the first nine months getting our product ready, winning our first customer in September 2011. Since then, we have seen significant and growing demand with at least 50 per cent year-on-year growth. “We’re on track to achieve revenues of £1m in 2015. International expansion is part of this plan, with targets of 25 per cent of revenue to be derived from growth abroad. We’ve got a proven market out there already, with several live export clients and about 60% of our sales leads coming in from the US” Although Matillion works with clients in manufacturing and wholesale distribution, it is now looking to expand into new areas including retail. “Technology innovation is what really excites the team here in Knutsford,” said Matthew. “We’re already into proof of concepts around a new solution, which retains our focus on speed and ease of use for customer advantage. If all goes to plan, we’re hoping to bring this to market early 2015 which will help to accelerate our growth plans even further.”   Follow ManchesterEveningNews @MENBusinessDesk @Asian_News Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Recently Published Black Friday 2014: Manchester shops prepare for busiest day of the year Elbows at the ready as Christmas bargain hunters scrabble for cut-price presents Quorum seals pair of deals worth £5m Missing Stockport man could be in Paris Previous Articles Historic Stockport pub returned to its former glory The Grade II listed George and Dragon in Cheadle, which had sat derelict for many years, has had a £450,000 makeover Police increase park patrols after woman is sexually assaulted Watch: Mum who lost leg in a crash finds new lease of life - as a pole dancer Related Tags Places Cheadle and Cheadle Hulme Bury Premier League News Recommended in Business Wigan School fitness company Commando Joe’s secures £1m government funding The University of Manchester Man City bosses pour £175m into Owens Park student campus Shopping Luxury fashion label Michael Kors opens new Manchester store Business Keys handed over at Vimto Gardens Business Baker Tilly score hat-trick of deals Business The Riverside Company buys majority stake in Brookson Airport City Plans submitted for 260,000 sq ft Airport City warehouse Most Read in Business The University of Manchester Man City bosses pour £175m into Owens Park student campus Airport City Plans submitted for 260,000 sq ft Airport City warehouse Business Keys handed over at Vimto Gardens Spinningfields Pictures: Inside La Bandera - the new Spanish restaurant given seal of approval by David Silva Alan Sugar \"Will Lord Sugar choose Mark or Bianca?\", former Apprentice star Neil Clough looks ahead to the final following latest episode Recommended on MEN Manchester Live: Mad Friday in Manchester Manchester United FC Van Gaal tells Man Utd they'll have to be 'perfect' to take advantage of slip-ups in the title race Manchester United FC Man Utd's Fellaini and Rojo to miss trip to Aston Villa Manchester City FC Pellegrini challenges Chelsea to prove their Premier League bottle Manchester Picture exclusive: Brave boxer Anthony Crolla back home after suffering serious injuries tackling burglars Education Chair of governors who helped transform school dubbed one of the worst in Britain steps down Greater Manchester News Live: Manchester Breaking News – December 19, 2014 Shopping Watch: What would you like for Christmas?

The proposal contains amendments from previously rejected proposals and has sparked a consultation period. A public meeting has been arranged in reaction. Glamorgan Power Company re-submitted an application to commence mining at Varteg Hill in November 2014 – 10 years on from their first. They now submitted an amended version of the same application to Torfaen council, including the health impact, assessment of the significance of impacts on developments of historic landscapes (ASIDOHL), a hydrology repot, legal aspects, housing issues and assurances over the restoration of the land post development concerning funding. Residents and politicians from the borough have long fought the plans, and a public meeting is scheduled for Thursday, February 11 with Torfaen council attending. Joint chair of 'the no campaign', Tony Kinsella, believes the latest amendment to the application has not altered greatly from its predecessors. “My fear is that if this application is approved, it will open to the floodgates to other proposals as Varteg Hill is testing the guidelines of the Minerals Technical Advice Note (MTAN),” he said. “The MTAN states that no settlements can exist within 500m of the proposed site, but there’s a school right in the middle of the plans – it looks like it is the same plan to me.” The period of consultation on the development remains open until March 11, with the council welcoming comments over the proposals. “It’s a farce if you ask me,” said Mr Kinsella. “The coal industry is dying as there are only 10 coal-powered power stations left in the UK, and three of those are closing in April. “Exporting coal is cheaper than taking it out of the ground here in Wales, so why they are persisting with development? I can’t understand,” he added. Lynne Neagle, Torfaen’s AM, said: “I have been a longstanding campaigner against this development. “This new application is almost identical to the one that was previously rejected by Torfaen Council and the Welsh Government. “I therefore remain deeply concerned about how close the proposed development is to residents' homes and Ysgol Bryn Onnen,” she added. Ms Neagle has raised the issue of mining at Varteg Hill at the Senedd, fronting debates on the matter and posing questions to the First Minister Carwyn Jones over the MTAN and possible reviews of its guidelines. “I am also very worried about and the impact on surrounding communities such as Blaenavon,” added Ms Neagle. “Torfaen Council are currently consulting on this new application and I would encourage all residents to have their say by responding to the consultation and also to attend the public meeting on Thursday February 11 at Varteg Community Hall. “I will be ensuring that all the views raised with me by residents are fed into the consultation and will also be arranging a drop in surgery in Varteg to enable residents to discuss the application with me,” she said. In response to the amendments, a spokesman from Torfaen council said: “We have received updated and additional information in relation to this application, which requires further consideration and consultation.” The public meeting over the planning application for land reclamation and coal recovery at Varteg Hill starts at 6.30pm on Thursday, February 11. Comments on the proposals from concerned individuals must be submitted to the council by Friday, March 11, quoting the application number of 14/P/00637. Details on the planning application can be viewed at Ty Blaen Torfaen, Panteg Way, New Inn, Pontypool, NP4 0LS on weekdays from 8.30am-5pm (4.30pm Fridays).

Even then, long before modern suppression means were put in place to protect both lungs and ears. But. who cares about Varteg, certainly not those who live in Blaenavon, now their land has been reclaimed and beautified. As someone began this thread, typical NIMBY territory. Further, there could be a potential air pollution hazard if modern preventative measures were not taken to eradicate it, but as most of the residents will no longer be working at the coal face, the hazard, being scientifically reduced, is unlikely to cause any problems to residents, or those kids in the Ysgol. So unless you have a full scientific study demonstrating the opposite, I respectfully suggest you do the honourable thing, and retreat, before you make a further ass of yourself.

Not a mention of the meeting of two weeks ago when the AM, Lynn Neagle, met with ONLY actual Varteg residents who are in favour of the project. She expressed her surprise, I think she did anyway, to see so many at that meeting, which took place mid afternoon, when probably most of the supporters were at work. At least the next meeting, open to all, will be in the evening, when as many as possible, hopefully,will attend. But that meeting is being called by TCBC, which, had it followed the Inspectors report, the project would be half finished by now. Instead we are being subjected to another round of indecision, and moaning by a large number of non local residents. No doubt, which will influence any further action by the council, basing it's decision on numbers who turn out, and to hell with those who actually live on top of the job.

A little digging (excuse the pun) via such resources as Companies House will show that this almost certainly involves an area stretching from the Glyn Valley to the Varteg in an East-West direction and from Talywain to Blaenavon in a South-North direction.

From the ignorant messages you send in, invariably accompanied by inane insult, it seems the only idiot around appears when you approach that mirror. I am also sure you cannot help failing to present a cogent argument, and so resort to insults. Maybe your mirror image can do it for you.

By Ben Midgley | Fri 11th March 2016 - 12:55 pm Well, let’s begin with this, it won’t be heaven on earth, but it certainly wouldn’t be hell on earth either.  Liberalism is not in my view, utopian, it is pragmatic and ethical, stemming from a set of principles for governance that tend towards the capacity for any society to thrive. Britain is class ridden, and economically and socially divided, naturally these groups collude and come into conflict, a Liberal Britain would prevent these special interest groups from overpowering the rights and responsibilities of each and every citizen in law and opportunity. Harnessing to the greater good, the productive capacity of competition through regulation, rather than allowing conflicts to simmer into a demoralising morass through indifference or monopolies. The different endowments in society suffer if political representation is skewed away from something which reflects the situation on the ground, and that in turn chokes our capacity to thrive, it turns people towards authoritarian solutions. So, a Liberal Britain would have an accessible political system that proportionally represents the will of the people, lives with the compromises that it produces and engenders something more tolerant than we now see. It rests on good will, rather than the desperate and often immoral striving for self assertion.  The country has a simply outstanding legacy, in every regard, it’s cultural, natural and human resources seem simply boundless considering its scale. A Liberal Britain trusts in the ability of the people, in possession of this place and heritage to contribute to its furtherance, to enhance its standing, to share its gift widely and generously. To learn from others, welcome those who would learn from us, and partner properly with others to advance prosperity in its widest sense. All that said, Liberalism cannot afford to be naive, it has real enemies, and will need defending by an infrastructure that is not simply exceptional in its capabilities, but is also an active arm of our diplomatic and humanitarian efforts. Respected and welcomed as a stabilising and productive influence, under the direction of society that is not simply looking after its own interests abroad. It also needs defending at home from criminality and the kind of anti-social conduct that wears away at the efforts of the majority to achieve its goals. Speedy, enlightened, and effective justice lowers the tensions within society and continually demonstrates the standards expected in practical ways. This piece is part of the Your Liberal Britain series of posts here on Lib Dem Voice.

Advert 4 Comments Stuart 11th Mar '16 - 1:20pm As a non-Lib Dem, it seems to me that though Liberalism may be pragmatic in theory, the Lib Dems themselves are the least pragmatic of all the mainstream parties, and as a pragmatist myself I find this one of the things that most puts me off voting Lib Dem. For a perfect example of what I mean you only have to compare the Lib Dems’ total inability to solve its diversity problems with the big improvements made by other parties (even the Tories) over the last 10-20 years.

Advertising Enquiries Contact Competitions Stacey aims to net mental health stigma May 29, 2013 by Grace Franklin · 1 Comment  Langside College student Stacey Morgan – entirely on her own initiative – has organised a major 7-a-side football tournament at Hampden to raise awareness of mental health. Stacey has returned to studying after working for ten years with Quarriers. Stacey, a 2nd year undergraduate doing a BA Degree\\Diploma in Education and Social Services at Langside College and Strathclyde University, got the idea for the event – called The Charleston Cup – during her placement in the Community Development Service in the Charleston Centre in Paisley. The tournament is being held at Lesser Hampden on Saturday 1 June and will kick off at 1pm, preceded by a speech by Tony McLaren from Breathing Space Scotland. Ten teams will be competing from Sunday central amateur leagues and the local community. They include league winners Bellgrove Amateur F.C. The event is being supported by a number of major mental health charities and will also feature information on mental health and mental health services, provided by RAMH, Breathing Space Scotland and See Me. There will be mental health quizzes with prizes and a See Me project for people to participate in to help reduce the stigma of mental ill health. Says Stacey: “I choose to promote mental health awareness not just because it was part of my course or placement but because it is something that I am passionate about and something that’s close to my heart. I lost a close family member to suicide. It was only through my course that I was educated about mental health and I realised how important it is to break down the stigma of mental ill health and openly talk about it to allow people to come forward and get support.” The event will also feature a free raffle with prizes including Hampden Experience passes, signed Rangers Football Club goodies, hair and beauty vouchers, vouchers for Domino’s Pizza and gift vouchers for reflexology, Swedish massages and aromatherapy massages. There will be a bouncy castle for children as well as a penalty shoot-out for everyone to enjoy. Added Stacey: “The local community and shops and pubs have really got behind this. It should be fun so that everyone enjoys themselves and at the same time, learns something about mental health .’ Stacey, who is 28, worked for ten years in social care in Quarriers before adding to her knowledge by studying for a BA in Education and Social Services.

But if the EU continue to give more people a refugee status it will only lead to more dead children. The only way to save children like that boy from dying is to start sending everybody who crossed the border illegally to the country where they came from.

The point that the BBC fails to recognise, in its determination to attack Cameron's perfectly reasonable position, is that this family were in Turkey - so their lives were no longer in danger. They wanted to go to Germany because it has offered Syrians asylum (no questions asked) and because they'd have a better life. So they were economic migrants who put their children in an overloaded boat to emigrate illegally to Europe and it sank. Barney_Barnes [+-] Political musings: 38 Joined: 07 May 2015, 19:40 Forum Member 04 Sep 2015, 14:18 It does make me angry that the left, the BBC and the Labour party leadership contenders are using the death of the two little boys and their mother as a political point scoring exercise against Cameron and the Tories. They, along with the incompetent EU, are painting the UK government as heartless and uncaring. The UK is the second most generous in spending money in Syria, more than those countries who are criticising us. The low numbers (in the hundreds) often quoted by the anti Tory faction as those who the UK have granted asylum; as opposed to the numbers other countries have taken in, are those that are special cases and have been taken direct from the camps. The UK has actually given sanctuary to thousands of others. The comparison to other EU states is disingenuous too. Both France and Germany are a lot bigger than the UK and while our birthrate is rising, Germany's is falling, so our overcrowded island will become even more overcrowded and our infrastructure further overstretched. It is also hypocritical of the Labour party to attack this government. It is not our government's fault that people are drowning in the Mediterranean. The seeds of this crisis was sown 15 years ago by Tony Blair's disastrous foreign policies and his governments virtual dismantling of the means of deporting those who have no right to be here with the incorporation of the Human Rights Act into UK law. Using this tragic events to try to embarrass or coerce the government to change their asylum or immigration policy is disgusting. As has been pointed out, this family were not fleeing a dangerous country, but were in Turkey, if they had the money to pay scummy people smugglers, why not try and get into Europe by more legal and safer means? The people to blame are the evil money grubbing people smugglers, and sorry to have to so say, some responsibility must go to the father. The answer is not to make it easier for people to attempt the dangerous journey to Europe, but to dissuade them to make the journey in that first place. That is what the UK is doing with some of the millions of pounds of overseas aid it is spending in Syria, and which is having some success. Still, when has facts got in the way of a good opportunity to attack and smear the Tories as nasty and uncaring and anyone who complains about immigration as racist. The UK has a good record of giving refuge to those fleeing persecution or danger, from the Jews to the boat people to those thrown out of Uganda. I believe most people would not want to turn their backs on genuine asylum seekers. However, we have experienced an unprecedented rise in our population in the last ten years, something that never happened before other mass migrations into the UK, so people think we can take no more. The big problem as I see it is that the difference between genuine asylum seekers and economic migrants has become blurred. This has not been helped by those of the left who insist that every migrant deserves the right to enter Europe and the UK no matter for what reason they left their own country. Unfortunately this has hardened and coloured the attitude against all migrants.

The latter would probably be cheaper (given the scale of the refugee crisis) but (because there are no western-backed Safe Zones, within any of the countries the immigrants come from) it would alas require some modest military action, to clear some square kilometers & errect tents, and hopefully a fight-back... Unfortunately... 1. Because this refugee crisis benefits Labour's electoral prospects should many refugees become citizens (since the immigrant vote is disproportionately like to support Labour http://www.racecard.org.uk/equality/rac ... ic-voters/ and be default also Corbyn type candiates. His own constituency is merely 57% white British http://www.vai.org.uk/wp-content/upload ... ummary.pdf though that's quite high by London standards. 2. And because Corbyn \"cannot think of any circumstances\" he would send British troops abroad, expect Labour to fight resolving the cause of this problem, tooth & nail. So whatever you do, do it as best you can.

In fact, that ignoble distinction belongs to the barrel bombs being dropped by the military of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. The Islamic State has distracted us from this deadly reality. Barrel bombs are improvised weapons: oil drums or similar canisters filled with explosives and metal fragments. They are dropped without guidance from helicopters hovering just above antiaircraft range, typically hitting the ground with huge explosions and the widespread diffusion of deadly shrapnel. They pulverize neighborhoods, destroy entire buildings and leave broad strips of death and destruction. The Syrian military has dropped barrel bombs, sometimes dozens in one day, on opposition-held neighborhoods in Aleppo, Idlib, Dara’a and other cities and towns. They have pulverized markets, schools, hospitals and countless residences. Syrians have described to me the sheer terror of waiting the 30 seconds or so for the barrel bomb to tumble to earth from a helicopter hovering overhead, not knowing until near the very end where its deadly point of impact will be. From the start of the war, the Assad government has pursued a murderous policy toward Syrian citizens who happen to live in areas that have been seized by opposition armed groups. The apparent aim is to kill and terrorize civilians (and destroy civilian structures) so as to drive civilians from opposition-held areas and to send a warning of the misery that attends anyone whose neighborhood is taken by opposition groups. Mr. Assad is thus pursuing the “total war” strategy that the Geneva Conventions and the laws of war flatly prohibit and criminalize. Beyond killing civilians, barrel bombs are playing a big part in forcing Syrians from their country. In most wars, civilians can find a modicum of safety by moving away from the front lines. But Mr. Assad’s indiscriminate use of barrel bombs deep in opposition-held territory means that for many there is no safe place to hide. That ugly reality has played a major part in persuading four million people to flee the country. Yet the international community has made little effort to stop Mr. Assad’s barrel bombing of civilians. The two governments with the greatest potential to influence Mr. Assad — his principal backers, Russia and Iran — have refused to get him to stop. Western governments have been reluctant to exert strong public pressure on them because of other priorities — Ukraine, in the case of Russia, and the nuclear deal, in the case of Iran. The European Union is putting far more effort into stopping Syrian asylum seekers from reaching the Continent than addressing the root causes of their flight. The United States and Turkey recently announced a plan to make a 60-mile strip in northern Syria an “ISIS-free zone,” but the goal is to fight ISIS militants, not protect civilians. In February 2014, the United Nations Security Council demanded an end to the “indiscriminate employment of weapons in populated areas, including shelling and aerial bombardment, such as the use of barrel bombs,” but it has not done much to stop it. Western governments are now proposing a new Security Council resolution that would have the United Nations monitor the use of barrel bombs and that hints at, though does not actually impose, sanctions should the barrel bombing continue. If Russia blocks further Security Council action, Western nations should start ratcheting up public pressure on Damascus for using this indiscriminate form of warfare and on Moscow and Tehran for backing it. Because of Western reticence, too few people understand the extraordinary slaughter that the Syrian military is committing with its barrel bombs. Mr. Assad’s chlorine gas attacks, terrifying as they are, kill a tiny fraction of the barrel-bomb toll, though they have recently attracted more attention than the barrel bombs. Western nations should also continue to collect evidence of Syrian war crimes, and if Russia persists in blocking the International Criminal Court from having jurisdiction to pursue war-crimes charges, an alternative tribunal should be found. One reason for soft-pedaling is a fear that ending the barrel-bomb attacks might undermine Mr. Assad’s ability to cling to power, and thus facilitate an Islamic State takeover. But barrel bombs are so imprecise that the Syrian military does not usually drop them near the front lines, for fear of hitting its own troops. They are useful mainly for pummeling civilian neighborhoods. That is one reason residents of opposition-held parts of Aleppo told me that, unlike in almost any other war, some civilians have — astonishingly — moved closer to the front lines, preferring to brave the more predictable artillery and snipers than the barrel bombs’ random death from the sky. The failure to address the barrel bombs arguably helps extremist groups like the Nusra Front and the Islamic State, which recruit Syrian members by presenting themselves as the most powerful military force to counter Mr. Assad’s government’s atrocities. President Obama has reportedly been reluctant to act too decisively in Syria for fear that he might then “own” the country and the chaotic mess it has become. But firmer pressure on Syria, Russia and Iran to stop the barrel bombs wouldn’t make the United States responsible for anything other than fewer civilians dead, injured and displaced. Some say that, rather than targeting a particularly monstrous weapons system, the best way to end the barrel bombs is to make peace. That is a laudable goal, but few believe a negotiated solution to the Syrian crisis is anywhere near. In the meantime, virtually all the Syrians I have spoken with agree that stopping Mr. Assad’s barrel bombs is probably the single most urgent task to reduce their suffering now.

GenreAction, Thriller CastRichard Madden, Charlotte Le Bon, Kelly Reilly, Idris Elba. DirectorJames Watkins. WriterAndrew Baldwin. CountryFr/US Duration92 mins Official site Release22/04/2016 A small-time criminal is in the wrong place at the wrong time in director James Watkins' action-packed thriller, which promotes Idris Elba as the next iteration of agent 007 when Daniel Craig holsters his Walther PPK for good. Shot on location in London and Paris, Bastille Day boasts a thrilling rooftop chase performed by the actors rather than stunt doubles. Elba is a surly, muscular presence at the centre of every action sequence. After one breathless chase, his strapping 6-foot 3 CIA agent asks a petty criminal why he decided to run. \"You were coming after me. Have you seen yourself?\" comes the tongue-in-cheek response. Budgetary constraints and haphazard plotting from screenwriter Andrew Baldwin conspire against the leading man, and misfiring on-screen chemistry with co-star Richard Madden undermines Watkins' dream of crafting a mismatched buddy cop movie in the vein of 48 Hours or Lethal Weapon. Foregoing expensive slam-bang thrills, Bastille Day opts for murky political intrigue and a grand conspiracy that confirms the biggest crooks are powerful men in suits, who should be serving and protecting the public, not greedily fleecing them. Expert pickpocket Michael Mason (Madden) steals passports, accessories and smartphones at major tourist hot-spots like the Sacre-Coeur at Montmartre to fulfil orders for middleman Baba (Eriq Ebouaney). During a scouting mission, Michael spies a young activist, Zoe Naville (Charlotte Le Bon), in a state of distress. She isn't paying attention to her shopping bag, so Michael expertly swipes it when her back is turned. He takes the valuables and casually discards the bag, unaware that a bomb is buried inside. The device detonates, killing innocent bystanders, and Michael is unwittingly condemned a terrorist by CCTV footage. Rogue US operative Sean Briar (Idris Elba), who is assigned to the CIA station in Paris under Karen Dacre (Kelly Reilly), vows to apprehend Michael before an elite French SWAT team led by Rafi (Thierry Godard). A game of cat and mouse between Briar, Michael and Rafi plays out around the arrondissements. Meanwhile, the real bombers plan their next move, creating a public relations nightmare for the embattled French Minister of Homeland Security, Victor Gamieux (Jose Garcia). Bastille Day was originally scheduled to open in February, but the film's release date was, understandably, pushed back two months in the aftermath of the terror attacks in the French capital. Opening scenes of the bomb blast outside a metro station in a bustling square are chilling without seeming gratuitous. Elba effortlessly copes with the physicality of his role, but Madden is a tepid sidekick, and Le Bon is completely superfluous. There are undeniable pleasures here - including an occasionally hilarious verbal exchange - but they are scant and slight.

CountryUS Duration151 mins Official sitewww.batmanvsuperman.dccomics.com Release25/03/2016 Heroes rise and fall in Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice, a super-powered smackdown involving two of DC Comics' most popular characters that neatly tees up a blitzkrieg of Justice League features and blockbuster spin-offs. With Zack Snyder, director of Man Of Steel, at the helm, every frame is crammed to bursting with artfully composed destruction. Gun barrels unleash spinning cylinders of hot metal in lustrous slow motion, a female victim tumbles to the floor amidst a cascade of milky white pearls from her broken necklace, exploding vehicles pirouette through the nighttime air during a high-velocity chase. While visuals stage a full-scale assault on the eyes, Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer cranks up the volume in collaboration with Dutch producer Junkie XL. If nothing else, Batman V Superman delivers a cacophony of slam and bang. Screenwriters Chris Terrio and David S Goyer haven't scrimped on character development or narrative, knitting together sinewy subplots with flashbacks and dream sequences involving Thomas Wayne (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) to embellish the origin stories of the titular combatants. Unquestionably, there is a leaner two-hour film lurking within this bloated beast, but brevity has never been one of Snyder's virtues. The world struggles to come to terms with the arrival of Metropolis' modern-day messiah, Superman (Henry Cavill). A committee led by Senator June Finch (Holly Hunter) asks uncomfortable questions about the god-like protector and his ability to crush humanity. Martha Kent (Diane Lane) tells her son that he doesn't owe the human race anything but Clark's heart belongs to Daily Planet co-worker Lois Lane (Amy Adams). \"I don't know if it's possible for you to love me - and be you,\" she worries. Unfortunately, tortured vigilante Batman (Ben Affleck) holds Superman accountable for the deaths of the innocent and declares war. \"Maybe it's just Gotham City and me - we have a bad history with freaks dressed as clowns,\" snarls the orphaned philanthropist, who is aided by his sardonic butler Alfred (Jeremy Irons). While the two crimefighters are locked in battle, inflamed by the scheming of Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg), a new threat arises. When all hope seems lost, Amazonian warrior Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) enters the fray... Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice aims for a similarly downbeat tone to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, replete with explosions of bone-crunching violence. Action sequences are robust but the miasma of digital effects sometimes reduces skirmishes to a blur. Snappy dialogue sounds like it has been torn from the pages of comic books and Affleck and Cavill engage in a battle of topless posturing and chisel-jawed stoicism. Eisenberg's twitchy, psychotic archnemesis stays the right side of pantomime - just. \"Nobody cares about Clark Kent taking on the Batman,\" screams Daily Planet editor-in-chief Perry White (Laurence Fishburne). I beg to differ.

As time goes on, Davis reverts to more extreme tactics to feel again. GenreComedy, Drama, Romance CastNaomi Watts, Heather Lind, Jake Gyllenhaal, Judah Lewis, Chris Cooper. DirectorJean-Marc Vallee. WriterBryan Sipe. CountryUS Duration99 mins Official sitewww.foxsearchlight.com/demolition Release29/04/2016 Grief, we're told, comes in many different forms. There's no wrong way to grieve, apparently. Except of course, there is. And nowhere is grief more structured than in Hollywood. There, grief is either a granite albatross weighing the sufferer down until eventually they crack and, more often than not, scream at a coldly beautiful landscape until finally, their artful tears fall, or, it is quite the opposite; it is a fully formed thing from the offset. This much-seen Hollywood version of grief is a blanket which the sufferer is wholly covered and fully in tune with, basking in their loss while a soundtrack of touching acoustic songs play out as the screen is flooded with a golden-tinged montage of 'better times'; long beach walks, ice creams licked off noses and soft punches on the arm, before realising with a shrug, that of course, \"This...\" - be it selling the house, finding a new partner, or donating their beloved's cardigan - \"...is what he/she would have wanted\". Demolition, the new comedy drama from Wild and Dallas Buyers Club director Jean-Marc Vallee, then offers neither trope for its anti hero, Davis Mitchell (Jake Gyllenhaal). It's not a version of grief any of the dearly departed would want for their loved ones. Widowed after a car accident killed his wife Julia (Heather Lind), the young banker is left with a numbness he can't shake. He's not just numb about his high-flying job at the bank, where his father-in-law Phil (Chris Cooper) also happens to be the boss, or his covetable home and possessions, he's also indifferent to Julia's death and unmoved by his colleagues and loved ones' needs for him to heal, or at least heal in a way they understand. The only person who penetrates his apathetic exterior is Karen (Naomi Watts). As the customer services representative for a vending machine company, Karen receives a letter of complaint from Davis about the machine in the hospital which gobbled his money, but didn't give him his goods on the night of his wife's death. But while he writes about the complaint, he also expands on his life and loss, until eventually his letters become increasingly confessional in tone to the point where Karen and Davis meet and strike a friendship. Soon, Davis becomes entwined in Karen's life and that of her troubled teenage son Chris (Judah Lewis) who has become cold and distant to her lately. As time goes on, Davis reverts to more extreme tactics - much to the shock of Phil - to feel again and, with the help of Karen and Chris, to rebuild his life and, in turn, unlock the struggles Chris is going through. While sentimentality could be rife, Demolition avoids it largely due to the welcome flashes of humour and thoughtful performances from Gyllenhaal and his young co-star Lewis, but it's just a shame that Watts is underwritten.

One high profile target is under surveillance at a house in Kenya. At a command base in Sussex, Colonel Katherine Powell has a direct link to US drone pilot Steve Watts and she watches in horror as covert footage reveals targets in the house are wearing suicide vests primed for an imminent attack. GenreDrama, Thriller, War CastBarkhad Abdi, Jeremy Northam, Alan Rickman, Aaron Paul, Helen Mirren. DirectorGavin Hood. WriterGuy Hibbert. CountryUK Duration102 mins Official sitewww.bleeckerstreetmedia.com/eyeinthesky Release15/04/2016 The art of modern warfare is no longer consigned to battlefields on the ground. Devastating missile attacks, pinpointed by drones, have allowed politicians to strike at the heart of supposed terrorist networks without having to stare into the whites of the enemies' eyes. Yet with greater power comes crushing responsibility - all technology is prone to error and one misplaced explosion can be exploited as propaganda to intensify the cycle of violence. \"Revolutions are fuelled by postings on YouTube,\" observes one nervous politician in Eye In The Sky, an intelligent and timely thriller that asks if there is such a thing as acceptable collateral damage in the pursuit of global freedom. Gavin Hood's nerve-racking film, tightly scripted by Guy Hibbert, doesn't have the answer to that complex moral conundrum. Instead, events on screen put the characters - and us - through the emotional wringer as a joint American and British taskforce decides if the slaughter of one innocent child is a tolerable consequence of neutralising a jihadist cell. Operation Cobra has been tracking radicalised British men and women linked to the Somali group al-Shabaab. One high profile target, Susan Danford (Lex King), is under surveillance at a house in Kenya, monitored by agents including Jama Farah (Barkhad Abdi). Lieutenant General Frank Benson (Alan Rickman) takes control of the operation from London while Foreign Secretary James Willett (Iain Glen), who is at an arms fair in Singapore, watches a live video feed from a US drone piloted by Steve Watts (Aaron Paul) in Nevada. At a command base in Sussex, Colonel Katherine Powell (Helen Mirren) has a direct link to Watts and explains that the objective is \"to capture not kill\". When covert footage reveals targets in the house are wearing suicide vests primed for an imminent attack, priorities change. The clock is ticking and politicians on both sides of the Atlantic deliberate. Meanwhile, Watts and his spotter, Airman Carrie Gershon (Phoebe Fox), notice a nine-year-old girl (Aisha Takow) selling bread near the target house, who would be killed in a missile strike. Eye Is The Sky is dedicated to Rickman. He delivers a tightly coiled performance as the go-between, who needs political and legal assent before issuing his command. Mirren is in equally imperious form while Paul exudes the anguish of a man wrestling with the consequences of defying orders. Hibbert's lean script envisions an almost tragic-comic contrast between the Brits, who repeatedly refer up the chain of command, and the unflinching Americans. This gallows humour dissipates some of the suffocating tension. With the precision of a drone missile, Hood's film begs uncomfortable questions about matters of life and death when they can be distilled to the squeeze of a joystick trigger in an air-conditioned cubicle thousands of miles from the intended kill zone.

CountryGer Duration92 mins Official site Release22/04/2016 Communication via online networking sites could kill your social life - and you - in German director Simon Verhoeven's ghoulish horror. A familiar array of attractive, yet vacuous, American college students are easy prey for Friend Request, which boasts a similar plot to the 2014 thriller Unfriended, albeit without that film's neat stylistic quirk of depicting slaughter in browser windows on the heroine's desktop screen. Verhoeven's picture is more conventional and achingly predictable, telegraphing misery for each unsuspecting victim as a malevolent spirit wreaks havoc in the real and dream worlds, accompanied by deafening shrieks on the soundtrack. These hoary, cheap scare tactics were outdated when fax machines were the latest technological marvel and certainly won't impress audiences who hanker for sophisticated shocks and nail-biting sustained tension. On an emotional level, we might feel concern or sympathy for the characters if the director and his two co-writers had invested time in developing their intricately intertwined personal relationships. Unfortunately, with so many people to dispatch in 92 minutes, the emphasis throughout is on cruel and gory demises. Laura Woodson (Alycia Debnam-Carey) is one of the most popular students at college and she shares every facet of her life, including her volunteer work, with more than 830 friends on Facebook. She regularly posts pictures of her boyfriend Tyler (William Moseley) and pals Olivia (Brit Morgan), Isabel (Brooke Markham), Gustavo (Sean Marquette) and Kobe (Connor Paolo), who has an unrequited crush on Laura. Troubled classmate Marina Mills (Liesl Ahlers) sends a friend request to Laura and, out of compassion tinged with pity, she accepts. Soon after, Marina becomes alarmingly possessive and clingy. \"Is she your friend or your first mental patient?\" cruelly asks Tyler. A little white lie about a birthday party tips Marina over the edge and Laura reluctantly clicks the Unfriend button on Facebook. Online rejection sparks tragedy and Marina commits suicide with a dramatic flourish, sending shockwaves across campus. As Laura wrestles with her guilt, her inner circle of friends receives creepy threats from the dead girl's Facebook account. One by one, Laura's nearest and dearest perish in grisly fashion, and hapless police struggle to make sense of the carnage. \"You really know a lot of dead people,\" deadpans dithering Detective Cameron (Shashawnee Hall). Laura resolves to break the deadly curse that has fallen upon her. Friend Request won't dissuade audiences from using smartphones to access a miasma of social media channels as soon as the end credits roll. Debnam-Carey and her co-stars aren't called upon to deliver compelling performances, just to master various expressions of shock and terror. Death sequences lack originality and most include a swarm of computer-generated black wasps, which are supposedly linked to witchcraft. Hashtag bogus pocus.

Only the Dragon Warrior - overweight dumpling-obsessed panda Po - can bring Kai's reign of terror to an end. So the power-crazed yak returns to the mortal plane and gallops towards the Jade Palace to lock horns with Master Shifu and his plucky disciples.

CountryUS Duration95 mins Official sitewww.kungfupandainternational.com/intl/uk/ Release11/03/2016 Prepare for the return of awesomeness in Jennifer Yuh Nelson's energetic martial arts comedy which kicks computer-animated butt and comes close to matching the rumbustious fun of the 2008 original. Screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger flashback to overweight panda Po's tortured past as the inspiration for this tale of identity and retribution, taking the story into far darker territory. However, Jack Black's whirlwind vocal performance provides a generous smattering of belly laughs and the visuals are gorgeous and colourful, notably in the frenetic set pieces which punctuate the narrative. The introduction of the 3D format almost warrants the additional ticket price, adding depth to the gorgeous rolling landscapes of ancient China replete with bamboo forests and ornate palaces. Younger audiences will get just as much fun though from the traditional 2D version without the discomfort or distraction of the plastic spectacles. Overweight panda Po (voiced by Black) is living his dream as an all-action bear, honing his skills under the watchful eye of mentor Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). However, he is haunted by fragmented memories, which eventually reveal how his father came to be a goose called Mr Ping (James Wong). It transpires that an evil peacock Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) is the cause of Po's deep emotional wounds. Spurred on by a dire warning about pandas from an elderly soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh), Shen and his army of snarling wolves are on a collision course with Po, armed with a deadly weapon that could bring China to its knees. Thankfully, Po can always rely on The Furious Five - Crane (David Cross), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Tigress (Angelina Jolie) and Viper (Lucy Liu) - to avert disaster. Kung Fu Panda 2 doesn't quite soar to the dizzy heights of DreamWorks' last animated feature, How To Train Your Dragon, but Yuh Nelson's film plays to its strengths. The sequel relies heavily on Black to unleash his verbal fireworks and to continue sparking potential romance with Jolie's kung fu kitty. Hoffman's comic timing is impeccable and Oldman delivers his lines in suitably Machiavellian tones. The action sequences are bigger and more complex but still fall short of the intricacy of Pixar's most recent pictures. Hopefully DreamWorks Animation will have learnt lessons about animated sequels from Shrek, which dazzled us in its original incarnation but became a creatively empty husk by yesteryear's Shrek Forever After. Alas, the feel good revelations at the end of Kung Fu Panda 2 suggest that as long as box office tills ring, there will be more chapters in Po's journey of self-discovery. Having achieved inner peace in this instalment, expect Kung Fu Panda 3 to tackle global child obesity by having its rotund hero achieve outer peace through a crash diet.

A long buried family secret finally slips out and Toula must rally all of her nearest and dearest to celebrate another blessed union at short notice. GenreComedy, Drama, Romance CastJohn Corbett, Michael Constantine, Nia Vardalos. DirectorKirk Jones. WriterNia Vardalos. CountryUS Duration94 mins Official sitewww.mybigfatgreekweddingmovie.com Release25/03/2016 Tottering down the aisle 14 years after My Big Fat Greek Wedding became the most successful romantic comedy of all time, Kirk Jones' sequel is like a batch of homemade baklava that has been left out too long and gone stale. Dry, flaky yet undeniably sweet, this second snapshot of daily life with the dysfunctional Portokalos family is studded with the same one-joke characters, who unite in adversity with fierce nationalistic pride. Screenwriter Nia Vardalos makes the second film to a similar recipe, flinging obstacles in the path of true love while various larger than life relatives excitedly offer their two drachmas worth of advice. Every exaggerated set piece is starved of belly laughs, from the family patriarch's repeated assertions that Greece gave birth to every modern invention - \"The Greeks created Facebook - we called it the telephone\" - to the nervous coming out of a gay character that feels like a non-event. Affection for the original film can only stretch so far and even at a trim 94 minutes, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 feels needlessly padded. It seems like a lifetime since Greek-American singleton Fotoula Portokalos (Nia Vardalos) shocked her nearest and dearest by falling in love with non-Greek upper middle class beau, Ian Miller (John Corbett). They are happily married with a rebellious 17-year-old daughter, Paris (Elena Kampouris), who is applying to colleges on the other side of the country so she can wriggle free of her overly protective parents. Toula's father Gus (Michael Constantine) is convinced he is a direct descendant of Alexander The Great and begins to research the family tree. In the process, he uncovers a long buried family secret: his marriage certificate to sweetheart Maria (Lainie Kazan) wasn't signed by the priest so in the eyes of the law, they aren't husband and wife. \"Who cares? We're married by time served,\" cackles Maria. Toula, her brother Nick (Louis Mandylor), cousins Nikki (Gia Carides) and Angelo (Joey Fatone), and interfering Aunt Voula (Andrea Martin) pledge their support to organising a wedding at short notice so Gus and Maria can tie the knot properly. Meanwhile Paris shrugs off Gus' suggestion that she needs to find a Greek husband as soon as possible and nervously prepares for a prom date with classmate Bennett (Alex Wolff). My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 is acrimoniously divorced from subtlety and invention. Jones' film goes through the motions with a depressing lack of urgency or purpose. Once again, Martin voraciously scene steals as the perfectly coiffed doyenne of fruity sexual advice. Vardalos drizzles on sticky sentiment at regular intervals in the vain hope that a few tears might flow in the absence of laughter. Even besotted fans of the blockbusting original will struggle to say, \"I do\".

WriterKevin Munroe, Gerry Swallow, T J Fixman. CountryUS Duration94 mins Official sitewww.ratchetandclankthemovie.com Release29/04/2016 Hollywood's turbulent relationship with the video gaming industry has frequently ended in tears including forgettable big-screen renderings of the Mortal Kombat, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Hitman franchises. The visceral thrill of assuming control of a digitised protagonist, whose destiny is literally in your hands, can't be replicated at 24 frames per second. Four films inspired by hugely popular games including The Angry Birds Movie, Warcraft and Assassin's Creed loom large on the horizon, and the 2016 onslaught begins with Kevin Munroe and Jericca Cleland's computer-animated romp. Ratchet & Clank is an energetic battle beyond the stars that affirms anyone can have a positive impact on the world. \"To be a hero, you don't have to do big things, just the right ones,\" sermonises one of the otherworldly characters, trumpeting a message of self-belief and courage that is hardwired into the linear and simplistic script. There's no quibbling with the film's worthy intentions. It's just a shame that the quality of the animation, vocal performances and narrative sophistication couldn't have strived for greatness too. Ratchet (voiced by James Arnold Taylor) is a furry, cat-like creature called a Lombax, who works as a mechanic on Planet Veldin in the Solana Galaxy, in a ramshackle workshop owned by his mentor and surrogate father, Grimroth (John Goodman). While he may be a wizard with a wrench, Ratchet openly dreams of becoming a laser gun-wielding Galactic Ranger like his idols, Captain Qwark (Jim Ward), Cora (Bella Thorne) and Brax (Vincent Tong). \"Dream smaller, it leads to less disappointment,\" counsels Grimroth tenderly. Unperturbed, Ratchet attends a trial for the Rangers. \"You may not have this chiselled jaw or God-given pectoral region but if you have heart, you may have what it takes,\" beams Qwark encouragingly to prospective candidates. Soon after, diabolical Chairman Drek (Paul Giamatti) and his hulking robotic henchman Victor (Sylvester Stallone) invade Veldin with their war bots. Ratchet and his cute mechanised sidekick Clank (David Kaye) unexpectedly save the day and their gallantry is rewarded with promotion to the esteemed ranks of the Galactic Rangers, which sows the seeds of Captain Qwark's jealousy. Chairman Drek and his chief scientist, Doctor Nefarious (Armin Shimerman), exploit these divisions to destroy the Galactic Rangers from within before they unleash their aptly named superweapon: the Deplanetizer. Ratchet & Clank is a solid and broadly comic introduction to the eponymous champions, who have appeared on various PlayStation platforms. Locations, weapons and flimsy plot threads from the games are merrily woven together into a conventional clash between good and evil. Heroes are immensely likable and pantomime villains cackle at regular intervals as they set their fatally flawed schemes in motion. Visuals are colourful and shiny if lacking in meticulous detail, especially when viewed on a widescreen canvas. Munroe and Cleland's picture encourages us to dream big, but its ambitions are extremely limited.

WriterCraig Mazin, Evan Spiliotopoulos. CountryUS Duration117 mins Official sitewww.huntsmanmovie.co.uk Release04/04/2016 Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all? Alas, not Cedric Nicolas-Troyan's functional prequel-cum-sequel to the 2012 fantasy Snow White And The Huntsman, which promises a yarn \"that comes long before happily ever after\". The Huntsman: Winter's War boasts jaw-dropping costumes, sets and production design, plus special effects-laden action sequences awash with rampaging goblins and a shape-shifting arch-villainess. However, all of the slick, digitally rendered beauty cannot disguise uneven performances and a plodding script by Evan Spiliotopoulos and Craig Mazin, which cynically melds Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen and the Brothers Grimm to woo audiences, who hanker for a live-action version of Frozen. Kristen Stewart is noticeably absent as Snow White, who appears fleetingly in flashback, but Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron reprise their roles as swaggering hero and scheming megalomaniac, on a collision course with destiny. If risible regional accents were a crime punishable under UK law, Oscar-nominated actress Jessica Chastain would be sentenced to life without parole. Her gung-ho attempts at a Scottish burr catalyse several moments of unintentional hilarity when her acrobatic warrior isn't somersaulting through breathlessly orchestrated fight sequences. Scheming Queen Ravenna (Theron) rules over her realm in the south with a steely glare, aided by the shape-shifting magic mirror. Her kind-hearted younger sister, Freya (Emily Blunt), falls madly in love with the Duke of Blackwood (Colin Morgan), who is promised to another, and falls pregnant with his child. Shortly after the birth of a baby girl, the Duke torches the infant in its crib, unleashing a wave of grief and fury in Freya that transforms her into The Ice Queen. She moves north, establishes her own kingdom and kidnaps children from nearby villages to mould into an army of heartless soldiers. \"Do not love. It's a sin... and I shall not forgive it,\" snarls Freya to her trembling charges. Two of her finest warriors - Eric (Chris Hemsworth) and Sara (Jessica Chastain) - defy this edict as adults and are cruelly punished. Seven years later, taking us beyond the events of the previous film, Snow White has vanquished Ravenna but the magic mirror continues to exert a malevolent control. Eric leads a mission to consign the golden adornment to sanctuary, aided by dwarf Nion (Nick Frost) and his half-brother Gryff (Rob Brydon). \"What happens if Freya gets the mirror?\" asks Sara. \"She'd be unstoppable\", growls Eric, laying the groundwork for a showdown between former allies. The Huntsman: Winter's War barely breaks sweat as it warps familiar fairy tales to facilitate a heavy-handed fable about love's redemptive glow. Blunt's solid portrayal of warped motherhood compensates for Theron's campy theatrics that threaten to nudge a bloodthirsty conflict into the realms of pantomime. Hemsworth glowers with his shirt on, Chastain simpers and Frost and Brydon provide comic relief alongside Sheridan Smith and Alexandra Roach as a pair of potty-mouthed female dwarfs.

Akela and Raksha refuse but Mowgli acknowledges his presence jeopardises the lupine clan. So he embarks on a perilous journey back to civilisation in the company of his protector, Bagheera the black panther (Sir Ben Kingsley). En route, Mowgli gathers honey for greedy Baloo (Murray) and is pressurised into sharing the secret of \"the red flower\" - fire - with menacing Gigantopithecus, King Louie (Christopher Walken).

CountryUS Duration108 mins Official sitemovies.disney.co.uk/zootropolis Release25/03/2016 Creatures great and small live in perfect harmony in Byron Howard and Rich Moore's anthropomorphic animated feature that continues Disney's winning streak under the creative leadership of John Lasseter. Zootropolis is a beautifully crafted parable that elegantly combines a noir detective thriller, buddy cop comedy and coming of age story with the studio's trademark visual splendour. It's a tour de force of uproarious laughter and tears, accompanied by a gorgeous genre-melding orchestral score from Michael Giacchino that tugs the heartstrings. Screenwriters Jared Bush and Phil Johnston engineer plentiful hairpin twists and turns, mining comedy from mammalian traits while underscoring each bravura set piece with valuable life lessons about prejudice, tolerance and teamwork. Neat visual gags abound including, a small time weasel criminal selling bootleg DVDs of Disney animations Wreck-It Rhino and Wrangled, or familiar chain stores that have been cutely rebranded for creature customers. Zootropolis even cheekily pokes fun at Frozen's song of empowerment, Let It Go, before unleashing its own infectious anthem, Try Everything, sung to the rafters by Shakira in the guise of a chart-topping savannah diva called Gazelle. Bunnyburrow carrot farmer Stu Hopps (voiced by Don Lake) and wife Bonnie (Bonnie Hunt) try to dissuade their daughter Judy (Ginnifer Goodwin) from pursuing her dream of becoming the first serving rabbit police officer in Zootropolis. \"If you don't try anything new, you'll never fail,\" chirpily professes Stu. Unperturbed, Judy earns her police badge as part of the Mammal Inclusion Initiative championed by Mayor Leodore Lionheart (JK Simmons) and his diminutive second in command, Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwether (Jenny Slate). Judy is initially assigned to traffic duty by Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), who doubts her abilities. In order to prove her worth, the new cop on the block vows to solve the case of a missing resident. \"I will give you 48 hours to find Emmitt Otterton. You strike out, you resign,\" growls Chief Bogo, sensing an opportunity to rid himself of the bouncing bunny. With the clock ticking, Judy gathers evidence from concerned wife Mrs Otterton (Octavia Spencer) and implores a con artist fox called Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) to help her break the case. Working with an animal who should be her sworn enemy, Judy stumbles upon a grand conspiracy involving Arctic shrew Mr Big (Maurice LaMarche), who presides over the criminal fraternity in Tundratown with his polar henchbears. Zootropolis is 108 minutes of unadulterated joy, rendered in exquisitely detailed animation. Vocal performances are flawless, particularly Goodwin as the dreamer with a big heart, who truly believes that anyone can achieve their dreams if they put their paws to it. A protracted sequence involving a three-toed sloth called Flash (Raymond S Persi), who works Department of Mammal Vehicles, is nothing short of genius. Hop to it - Zootropolis is the bunny's whiskers.

Picture by Paul Chesterton/Focus Images Ltd ©Focus Images Limited www.focus-images.co.uk +447814 482222 Norwich City clinched a battling 1-0 Championship win at Wigan to ease the pressure on Canaries’ chief Neil Adams and his players. Jonny Howson’s third goal in four games just five minutes into the contest at the DW Stadium proved the difference to seal only a second league win in 11 and a rare clean sheet for the visitors after leaking 11 goals in their previous four games. City old boy and Wigan chief Malky Mackay’s search for a first win since taking over in the north-west continued after a lacklustre response from his side to early adversity. Adams made three changes from the starting line up that lost 2-1 to Reading in the Championship. Carlos Cuellar came into central defence with Michael Turner paying the price for his role in that Royals defeat and Russell Martin retaining his place in the centre of defence. Gary O’Neil and Bradley Johnson came in for Kyle Lafferty and Nathan Redmond respectively with Adams opting not to fast-track the likes of Ryan Bennett, Wes Hoolahan or Vadis Ofoe into his matchday plans after injury. Gary Hooper and Cameron Jerome were retained up front with Lewis Grabban’s (groin) absence covered by a first sighting of Scottish teenager Conor McGrandles on the Norwich substitutes’ bench. Mackay restored Shaun Maloney to the Latics’ line up after missing last week’s Championship defeat at Sheffield Wednesday with illness in an attacking formation that also included James McClean and Callum McManaman. Former City defender Leon Barnett was also in the hosts’ starting XI. City started positively with Hooper prominent in the early exchanges and the visitors were rewarded when Howson ranged onto Hooper’s perfect cut-back to hammer a low right-footed strike into the bottom corner past Scott Carson. Jerome spurned a chance to double City’s lead two minutes later when he advanced into a similar position but tamely dragged at the former England keeper. Norwich’s front two were getting plenty of support from midfield and O’Neil clubbed over on his right from 18 yards after a patient bout of possession from Steven Whittaker and Howson. Cuellar had a lucky escape when he slipped to allow Marc-Antoine Fortune to race clear but the cross sailed harmlessly out of play. John Ruddy was pressed into action for the first time in the 15th minute when he gathered confidently at his near post to cut out McManaman’s corner. Cuellar rolled in Martin Olsson on the overlap but Wigan had enough numbers to clear but it was City dictating after Howson’s opener. Maynor Figueroa endured a lecture from the official after a cheap shot down the back of Hooper’s calf the striker took exception to. Ruddy claimed Maloney’s deep free kick to more supportive cheers from the away support stationed behind the Norwich keeper. Jerome’s brilliant flick around Figueroa dropped for Howson just past the half hour mark but O’Neil’s late run was spotted by Chris McCann who managed to guide a header back to Carson with the game now in a prolonged lull. Ruddy had to remain vigilant despite the lack of meaningful action when Fortune controlled Figueroa’s long punt on his chest and turned Cuellar to drill at the keeper. McManaman then linked with Fortune before unleashing a left footed strike from 20 yards that flew a couple of yards wide of Ruddy’s far post. James McClean’s industry foiled Martin who surged into the Wigan penalty box five minutes prior to the interval but delayed long enough for the Republic of Ireland international to produce a sliding block. Ruddy claimed McCann’s rising strike in the one minute of added on time. Mackay was forced into an early change two minutes after the interval when Maloney was withdrawn with what looked like an injury for the Scottish international. Olsson powered onto Hooper’s pass but Barnett bravely blocked at the concession of a corner Wigan eventually cleared. Ruddy’s positioning was again tested in the 52nd minute when he saved James Perch’s diving header from a Latics’ free kick delivered by McClean. Olsson was squared up by McManaman but Martin bailed out his full-back with a clearing header six yards out. Figueroa then held up Hooper who had anticipated Martin’s next intervention as the striker looked to run through to test Carson. Martin again made a timely intervention after Whittaker lost his bearings to allow McClean a chance to sneak in behind. Adams’ response to Wigan’s growing threat was to introduce Josh Murphy for Hooper in a bid to stretch the Latics on the counter. Wigan were now dominating territory and possession but City’s much-maligned backline were offering stout protection to Ruddy. Kyle Lafferty then replaced Jerome with Adams striving to fresh up his attacking options but the Northern Irishman’s aerial prowess was required inside his own box to clear McClean’s inswinging corner. Wigan were now committing men forward but McCann’s mistimed header was plucked out of the sky by Ruddy under no real pressure. Ruddy denied Wigan three times within a matter of seconds after Fortune, McClean and McManaman all tried to stab home inside the six yard box. Murphy’s slaloming run relieved the pressure when the youngster forced a free kick 19 yards out but Lafferty embarrassingly slipped at the moment of impact as the ball spiralled horribly wide. Lafferty was then grappled inside the Latics’ area by Figueroa but hauled himself to his feet only to miscue the shot to spare the official a penalty decision to make, before Murphy raced past Perch but his far post cross evaded the striker. Ruddy spilled McClean’s corner six minutes from time but unlike recent weeks Lafferty was on hand to bail out his keeper. Perch’s header from Ben Watson’s free kick then slipped wide as Mackay urged one final push from the hosts but City held on for a priceless win. • Wigan: Carson, Taylor, McCann (Delort 88), Watson, Maloney (Cowie 47), McClean, McManaman, Perch, Barnett, Figueroa, Fortune (Espinoza 83).

It's pocket change after all surely? I stand by everything that I said after our fourth game and not too many can disagree that I have been proven correct. They may not like a smart Alec but hey ho. If it's any consolation I was hoping to be proven wrong too and was really hoping that he would be well on the way to beating last season's total by now too? The Chief Scout and the Manager have a lot to answer for IMO but don't shoot the messenger. I had nothing to do with it.

Your issue with Grabban is strange and slightly disturbing. OTBC.

Since when has football been a one man game, to blame one player for Citys woes is stupidity beyond belief. As for getting off your back then get off his back, and no I am not a troll as you might suggest, Have supported this club for over 40 years, but what I do not like is somebody so blinkered they cannot see the wood for the trees. Add your comment | Report this comment Bald Canary Monday, December 8, 2014 Have never ever mentioned Jerome's luck. And yes, in comparison to Grabban, Hooper is pulling up trees. I asked for Hooper from the moment that he was fit and suddenly we're looking like we could win matches. LG has cost us more points than anyone else this season and if you can't see that them you need to get to spec savers. I will only be happy when he has left the club. I suspect that those calling for him to be played are trolls from up the A140 who also wanted NA and CH before him to stay. Maybe you should get off my back or even explain how I'm wrong? GH will only get better. You will see. IPWT Add your comment | Report this comment baguio Monday, December 8, 2014 You really cannot help yourself can you Baguio. So where have all these goals come from in the last eleven games, I would say mainly from the opposition, as for the rest of our strikers, not exactly scoring for fun. Jerome his luck as you would put it has dried up, Lafferty if he scored as many goals as he has picked up yellows he would be up there with the best. The only one shining striker out of these others is Hooper, and he is not exactly pulling up trees. So once again get off Grabbans back, and well done City for stopping the rot, hopefully MP will have instilled himself on the squad enough ready for the busy fixture list ahead. Add your comment | Report this comment Bald Canary Sunday, December 7, 2014 baguio - what is it with you and Grabban? You seem fixated on the poor lad - almost to the point of starkerish proportions! He didn't even play on Saturday and you're still talking about him. It's not healthy my man! Whatever his faults this season, please remember he got 22 goals in 46 games last year; you don't get that many through luck or chance - skill is required. I don't care if all those goals went in off his shin, a55 or love truncheon, he was in the right place at the right time to get a bag full of goals. He got 5 in 5 for us until we bought Jerome and the system changed; clearly that had a massive negative impact on him (and the team as a whole funnily enough). Did he deserve to be dropped a few games back? Yes. Is he suddenly a bad player? No. OTBC.

In the premiership two years ago we just scraped home. Last season we played even worse. Ask any neutral what they thought of our standard of play in the Premiership last year and they will say mid-table championship. And that is the standard we are playing this season. Compare us with the passion of Derby. Even when we were at our best earlier in the season we were not Premiership potential. Suppose we did get there through the play offs do we really have a manager and a squad that could crack it? No way- even with Motivation Maestro Lamber it was a struggle.

It is not to worry about whether this team could survive in the Prem. or whether we can attain instant promotion it is purely to stop the run of bad form and the Wigan game, for me made a start on that. Sometimes you have to concentrate on what matters at the time and if you do it right the future takes care of itself. Add your comment | Report this comment NICEONE Sunday, December 7, 2014 ET & Stew, you both make good points and in fact I think both live tv and being at the game have their merits. I am a season ticket holder and sit in the end of the Jarrold stand close to the river end. As I am fairly high up, I got a reasonably good view of both goals last week but it was not until I watched a slow motion rerun of both goals scored at the Barclay end that I realised that Turner was caught out for both goals. Yesterday, listening to the local radio, it appeared that Ruddy had made a great triple save, but watching the tv rerun, it clearly confirms ET's slant on the event. I used to spend a lot of my time travelling away to game, especially when playing etc but these days prefer to do other things, it is a shame that the club does not either show away games on a big screen at Carrow Road or broadcast them via Mustard TV. I would certainly be prepared to pay a sensible sum so that I could make a more valid comment on away games.

Add your comment | Report this comment Stew Pydsodd Sunday, December 7, 2014 Stat-Matt, I think what has been lacking in the last 2 months is the arrogance needed to win the Chump at a canter - which I believe we are still capable of doing. Remember that we were well on target for 100 points and 100 goals after 10 games before going on a very disappointing run and dropping points to some average sides with incomplete performances. Hopefully City can get back to winning ways from here - so the 0-1 away win at Wigan is a good and welcome start - lets hope we push our season on from here and secure immediate promotion. Add your comment | Report this comment Dubai Canary Sunday, December 7, 2014 Good to get the points, and hopefully we'll have a run now. NA penchant for picking his favourites is irritating. Whittaker? Bradley Johnson? But at least Cuellar got his reward as he played well at Forest and should've kept his place. Why not try Miquel and Cuellar at the back which could be the magic combo? Add your comment | Report this comment Disco Dale Sunday, December 7, 2014 Dubai Canary: why do you expect to win @ Wigan and why do you think that Norwich should win this league by 11-12 points? You need to start respecting where you are, I mean with all due respect Wigan were a Premier league team from 2005-2013 and won the FA cup two years ago and posses a very strong squad that is massively underachieving. The mere fact that you think your club has some sort of Devine right to be in the Premier league and winning this division at a canter is just pure arrogance. Birmingham won the Carling Cup in 2011 while in the Premiership and since relegation you don't hear there fans bleeting on about how they should be in the top flight again! Admittedly Norwich have a strong squad but it is certainly not the strongest one in this division by any stretch. For me the best team by far in this division is the one that currently sits atop of it and of course that is Derby County. You could argue that Leeds, Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest, Derby etc etc should be in the Prem for there massive fan base alone if not for the past success they have achieved??? I've also seen posts moaning that it is not acceptable that recently promoted clubs like Brentford and Bournemouth being above Norwich and challenging for promotion should not be happening. Do you forget that you were a league one team five years ago who went on to achieve back to back promotions???? In my honest opinion I believe it is now harder to win promotion to the Premiership than it is to actually survive in it and you need to start respecting the division you are in and hope that the players and management at Norwich don't have the same attitude as yourself because if they do you can expect to have a much longer stay in this division than you might like.

That said, we were MARGINALLY the better team,and Wigan are DIRE. I'll be shocked if they get out of the relegation zone the rest of the season. The defense looked much better which isn't a suprise as Turner was cemented the bench. For all the stick Bassong got last year, you have to realize how difficult it is to play both CB positions, which is what you have to do when you are partnered with Turner... Our forwards look hopeless. Hooper actually did a decent job linking up with people this game, but Hooray? I guess is all I have to say. For such a great \"finisher\" you all claim he is HE DIDN'T TAKE A SHOT the entire game. Grabban is a better option by far. At least he gets into places for opportunities and does't disappear for all but 10 minutes a game like Hooper. 3 points, but that performance was not pretty and it was against one of the worst teams in the league.

The festival will take place from Friday 22nd July until Sunday 24th July 2016 at Scone Palace, Perth, Scotland (www.scone-palace.co.uk).   As with the previous five Rewind Festivals at Scone Palace, this year’s Rewind extravaganza will provide an even bigger bang with the crème de la crème of classic 80’s pop music.   This year’s headline performances include the mesmerising Holly Johnson (Relax, Two Tribes) and Adam Ant (Stand and Deliver, Prince Charming). As with all past Rewind Festivals, the 80s celebrations will showcase non-stop music on the main stage from the biggest 80s icons, plus plenty of audience participation and plenty of nostalgic dressing up.   The festival includes an all-star 80s line-up featuring Rick Astley, ABC, Tony Hadley, Marc Almond, Go West, Roland Gift, China Crisis, Toyah, The Beat, Annabella’s Bow Wow Wow, plus many more big names, including legendary Scottish artists Midge Ure (Live Aid, Ultravox), The Bluebells, Average White Band and making their Rewind Scotland debuts, Living In A Box, Leo Sayer, Snap, and Slim Jim Phantom From Stray Cats.   One of the biggest highlights at this year’s festival is the Rewind Scotland debut of the British Electric Foundation. B.E.F. is the brainchild of Heaven 17’s Martyn Ware, and will showcase a unique and dazzling performance featuring a raft of legendary pop artists.   Ware has assembled a stellar line-up featuring the full Heaven 17 band performing songs made famous by the stars themselves, plus cover versions in the inimitable B.E.F. electronic pop style featuring Thomas Dolby, Black, Heaven 17’s Glenn Gregory, The Noisettes’ Shingai Shoniwa, Mari Wilson and The Farm’s Peter Hooton.   B.E.F.’s 80’s themed electronic extravaganza promises to be a hit-packed highlight of the entire weekend. Don’t dare miss it!   Tickets go on sale at 9am on Friday 29th January 2016. Full details about ticket outlets and prices are available from the official Rewind website: www.rewindfestival.com.   The festival will also feature plenty of additional non-stop festival fun from the Silent Disco to Live Karaoke Bar, as well as Camping and Glamping (aka Glamorous Camping) options. Additional festival necessities will be present, including a kidzone for the little ones, funfair, and a spectacular firework display to close the weekend. When Nature Calls wristbands will also be available giving festival goers access to posh loos.   Photo Credit: © Alan Rennie     All Dates 2016-07-24 00:00 May 2012 Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 26 May The Tannahill Weavers 17 Jun Daimh in Concert 24 Jul Rewind Scotland Scone William Shand Designs, 61 Albert Street, Dundee, DD4 6NZ Tel: 01382 459380"],

Share Share Tweet +1 Email David Traynor, chief executive, Byotrol Anti-microbial hygiene company, Byotrol, has reported that turnover is down but that it’s largely hitting its targets of increasing underlying sales. Turnover for the six months ending September 30 was £1.5m compared to £1.7m for the same period last year. The Daresbury-based group said it has reduced its administrative costs by 34 per cent, while EBITDA loss also reduced by 34 per cent to £263,000. The company reported that it has largely hit its targets of increasing underlying sales, reducing costs and developing better products. Byotrol has also been investing so that it will be ready for forthcoming regulatory and labelling changes in global chemical and consumer markets. The group said it is on a “positive trend towards taking the company towards profitability.” Chief executive of Byotrol, David Traynor said: “We have made good progress this half-year on several fronts. Underlying sales are up, costs are substantially down and we have now positioned our technologies for the diverging regulatory environments in the US domestic market and the EU market.” The group has also announced the appointment of Dr Trevor Francis to its board as chief technology officer. Dr Francis has been working as a consultant to the company in various positions over the last six years, particularly in consumer product development and commercialisation. Prior to joining Byotrol, Dr Francis spent 29 years at Unilever where he became vice president of the Global R&amp;D Homecare division and head of the European Fabric Conditioners &amp; Global Fragrance divisions.   Follow ManchesterEveningNews @MENBusinessDesk @Asian_News Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Recently Published Business set to take off as direct Manchester-China flights start on Monday Airline chiefs will descend on Manchester Airport on Monday for the inaugural Cathay Pacific flight, to jet in and out four times weekly Manchester expert warns classing obesity as a disability could be 'dangerous' Previous Articles A look at the week ahead Marks & Spencer's results are set to be the highlight of a busy week in the retail sector, with figures also due from Morrisons and Halfords Government urged not to scrap European arrest powers as figures reveal up to 30 wanted suspects on our streets Desperate migrant married stranger in bid to stay in UK with his parents Related Tags Organisations European Union Premier League News Recommended in Business Wigan School fitness company Commando Joe’s secures £1m government funding The University of Manchester Man City bosses pour £175m into Owens Park student campus Shopping Luxury fashion label Michael Kors opens new Manchester store Business Keys handed over at Vimto Gardens Business Baker Tilly score hat-trick of deals Business The Riverside Company buys majority stake in Brookson Airport City Plans submitted for 260,000 sq ft Airport City warehouse Most Read in Business The University of Manchester Man City bosses pour £175m into Owens Park student campus Airport City Plans submitted for 260,000 sq ft Airport City warehouse Business Keys handed over at Vimto Gardens Spinningfields Pictures: Inside La Bandera - the new Spanish restaurant given seal of approval by David Silva Alan Sugar \"Will Lord Sugar choose Mark or Bianca?\", former Apprentice star Neil Clough looks ahead to the final following latest episode Recommended on MEN Manchester Live: Mad Friday in Manchester Manchester United FC Van Gaal tells Man Utd they'll have to be 'perfect' to take advantage of slip-ups in the title race Manchester United FC Man Utd's Fellaini and Rojo to miss trip to Aston Villa Manchester City FC Pellegrini challenges Chelsea to prove their Premier League bottle Manchester Picture exclusive: Brave boxer Anthony Crolla back home after suffering serious injuries tackling burglars Education Chair of governors who helped transform school dubbed one of the worst in Britain steps down Greater Manchester News Live: Manchester Breaking News – December 19, 2014 Shopping Watch: What would you like for Christmas?

The festival will take place from Friday 22nd July until Sunday 24th July 2016 at Scone Palace, Perth, Scotland (www.scone-palace.co.uk).   As with the previous five Rewind Festivals at Scone Palace, this year’s Rewind extravaganza will provide an even bigger bang with the crème de la crème of classic 80’s pop music.   This year’s headline performances include the mesmerising Holly Johnson (Relax, Two Tribes) and Adam Ant (Stand and Deliver, Prince Charming). As with all past Rewind Festivals, the 80s celebrations will showcase non-stop music on the main stage from the biggest 80s icons, plus plenty of audience participation and plenty of nostalgic dressing up.   The festival includes an all-star 80s line-up featuring Rick Astley, ABC, Tony Hadley, Marc Almond, Go West, Roland Gift, China Crisis, Toyah, The Beat, Annabella’s Bow Wow Wow, plus many more big names, including legendary Scottish artists Midge Ure (Live Aid, Ultravox), The Bluebells, Average White Band and making their Rewind Scotland debuts, Living In A Box, Leo Sayer, Snap, and Slim Jim Phantom From Stray Cats.   One of the biggest highlights at this year’s festival is the Rewind Scotland debut of the British Electric Foundation. B.E.F. is the brainchild of Heaven 17’s Martyn Ware, and will showcase a unique and dazzling performance featuring a raft of legendary pop artists.   Ware has assembled a stellar line-up featuring the full Heaven 17 band performing songs made famous by the stars themselves, plus cover versions in the inimitable B.E.F. electronic pop style featuring Thomas Dolby, Black, Heaven 17’s Glenn Gregory, The Noisettes’ Shingai Shoniwa, Mari Wilson and The Farm’s Peter Hooton.   B.E.F.’s 80’s themed electronic extravaganza promises to be a hit-packed highlight of the entire weekend. Don’t dare miss it!   Tickets go on sale at 9am on Friday 29th January 2016. Full details about ticket outlets and prices are available from the official Rewind website: www.rewindfestival.com.   The festival will also feature plenty of additional non-stop festival fun from the Silent Disco to Live Karaoke Bar, as well as Camping and Glamping (aka Glamorous Camping) options. Additional festival necessities will be present, including a kidzone for the little ones, funfair, and a spectacular firework display to close the weekend. When Nature Calls wristbands will also be available giving festival goers access to posh loos.   Photo Credit: © Alan Rennie     All Dates 2016-07-24 00:00 August 2017 Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 26 May The Tannahill Weavers 17 Jun Daimh in Concert 24 Jul Rewind Scotland Scone William Shand Designs, 61 Albert Street, Dundee, DD4 6NZ Tel: 01382 459380"],

However, Chester playwright Gail Young decided to go one stage further and break a hip in the rehearsal room. The nasty accident could have resulted in the two shows she was directing having to be cancelled. Luckily for Gail, various colleagues stepped up to the plate to keep both the November show for Guilden Sutton Players on track and also her latest full length play Bothered and Bewildered which is being premiered by Tip Top Productions at the Forum Studio Theatre from October 14-18. Bothered and Bewildered is a comedy drama about life, love, and loss. As the audience watch Irene and her family struggle to come to terms with her Alzheimer’s, Irene’s past passion for romantic fiction blurs with reality and she discusses with her unseen companion Barbara Cartland (Irene’s favourite and now deceased world famous romantic novelist) how best to write her ‘memory book’. This is a very poignant comedy drama about what some experts describe as ‘the long goodbye’. As with her internationally acclaimed hit play Cheshire Cats, the premiere of Bothered and Bewildered is being staged as a fundraiser for a very good cause. Cheshire Cats initially raised a considerable amount of money for the breast cancer unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital. The Walk the Walk charity and other performing groups across the UK and the world have since gone on to use the play as an effective fundraising platform for breast cancer and other cancer related charities. Proceeds from the premiere of Bothered and Bewildered will be used to support the wellbeing of patients with dementia at both The Countess of Chester Hospital and Ellesmere Port Hospital. The hospital’s charity exists to provide enhanced facilities and additional pieces of equipment that are over and above core NHS provision to ensure every patient’s stay in hospital is as comfortable as possible. Head of fundraising at the Countess, Janet Ratcliffe, said: “We are delighted that Gail has once again decided to support our charity in this way. I went to the first play reading a few months ago and was really moved by this comedy drama and the characters that Gail has created. “We have already had a great deal of interest in tickets and I would urge people to book early to avoid disappointment.” Tickets are on sale now from Tip Top Productions.

Posted on 25th Feb 2013 at 10:00 by Antony Leather with 22 comments It’s an immensely exciting time for anyone interested in small form factor hardware. Whether you’re gaming and performance focused or interested in gear perfect for an HTPC, there’s plenty of new stuff arriving on shelves at the moment. Read more Tags intel nuc, m-sata, mini-itx Should size be the new battleground in the motherboard market? Posted on 8th Jun 2012 at 13:14 by Paul Goodhead with 67 comments I don’t think it’s unfair to say that the motherboard market has been getting a little stale of late. It’s a statement that’s likely to have the marketing managers from the big brands up in arms, but it wouldn’t surprise me if the thought had crossed their own minds more than once too.

Posted on 31st May 2010 at 02:49 by Richard Swinburne with 18 comments While we've had our concerns about the Mini-ITX bandwagon, it's still a trend that we're broadly in favour of. After all, small, potent PCs can be great. One of the nicest - and smallest mini-ITX cases we've seen comes from Taiwanese company Lutec's retail brand, SEED. SEED is a shoehorned acronym of \"Saving Energy Efficiency Directly\" - the brand promotes mini-ITX and low power chassis, as well as a few 80Plus ATX PSUs and some laptop accessories too. Click to enlarge Our interest was perked with the MU-380: a gently rounded and elegant aluminium mini-ITX case. It measures a very tiny 315 x 215 x 63mm, which also limits its compatibility to Atom-esq products under 6cm tall. Read more Tags htpc, htpc case, mini-itx, seed Will mini-ITX lead to disappointment? Posted on 27th May 2010 at 11:37 by Richard Swinburne with 32 comments If you've been reading the site recently, you've probably noticed the real resurgence of mini-ITX mortherboards. We've got Intel to thank for that since it's pushing the form factor hard this year - all these new mini-ITX boards are made for its Core i3 and i5 CPus with integrated graphics. However, mini-ITX has been a real backwater until now, which means that many of the companies are exploring unknown territory.

Akasa said that in order for the case to perform optimally, the mini-ITX board needed to be less than 30mm tall and we needed to use Akasa's LGA775 or AM2+ coolers specially designed for it. We checked our Gigabyte GA-230D and found the northbridge heatsink and fan was 35mm tall, while the Jetway NC92-330-LF was 29.5mm, as was the reference Intel Atom board. Click to enlarge Our immediate concern is \"how do I know what mini-ITX motherboard I buy is compatible?\" We looked around at mini-ITX boards listed on websites and seldom do they list the total height, making choosing the right board a very difficult task. Click to enlarge Another thing is the complete lack of manual in the box - we had to be instructed by Akasa of the \"correct way\" to install everything which is very specific. Just a sheet of A4 explaining that a 90 degree SATA connector is required (another additional purchase from Akasa), and the hard drive should be installed upside down and facing inwards would have been good.

Picture and video: Gary Louth A brave teenager who has battled bone cancer celebrated his recovery in style with a VIP shopping trip to London. Fashion-conscious Jack Seddon was diagnosed with the disease at the start of the year after complaining of a pain in his leg. When an X-ray revealed the seriousness of his condition, the 13-year-old was forced to have part of his leg amputated in a rare ‘rotationplasty’ operation. But after months of gruelling treatment, including intensive chemotherapy and physiotherapy, doctors have declared him in remission and fit enough to indulge in his favourite hobby. Jack, a student at All Hallows in Weaste, Salford, travelled to London with best pal Chloe Brickell, mum Victoria Butcher and his gran Valerie Hockham. The trip – organised by the Make-a-Wish charity – was his first time in the capital city. Victoria, 33, said: “It was just unreal. They’d thought of everything and it really was his dream come true. “We had a limo to take him to Harrods and Primark and they gave him goodie bags and some money to buy his clothes. He had his own personal shopper in Harrods and he picked some outfits out and we had afternoon tea there. “He was just overwhelmed. He loves Primark anyway, but just the whole experience was amazing. “I asked him what his favourite bit was and he said everything.” Jack added: “It was so exciting to know I could get loads of clothes because I love shopping. I would love to do it all again.” Video loading  The youngster, who was also recently treated to a day with the Manchester United players thanks to his school, still has to go for check-ups at hospital every six weeks and is due to have a prosthetic limb fitted in the new year. But Victoria, who is married to Andrew and is also mum to Harry, 15, and Mary-Grace, four, said he just ‘gets on with it’. The nursery nurse, from Weaste, added: “The best moment for me was just seeing him happy and the smile on his face – he was in his element doing what he loved best – shopping. “It was a shock when he got diagnosed but I’ve got great family and friends around me and we just got on with it. “A lot of people turned round and said ‘haven’t you cried?’ but you’ve got to keep smiling and laughing. “I said that to Jack and that’s what we did all the way through.” Jack Seddon is all smiles on his trip to Primark in London   Follow ManchesterEveningNews @MENNewsdesk @SueCarrTweets Recently Published It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas!

The message comes from officers who carried out a police sting, targeting drivers flouting the law on the A376 at Exton, Broadway in Woodbury, and Knowle Village Road, Budleigh Salterton. Police said drivers who flashed their lights to warn other motorists of the police operation were causing an offence and affecting findings. Police community support officer Sarah Trayhurn said: “Unfortunately, a few drivers decided to warn other drivers that police were in attendance by flashing their lights at other drivers. “This is an offence and would affect our speed statistics we share with other agencies, when we look at road safety and traffic- calming measures.” Devon and Cornwall Police said the recent action was about enforcement rather than education. The neighbourhood police team joined forces with the roads policing unit. Officers issued a total of 13 tickets to drivers; one for failing to wear a seatbelt, nine for using a mobile phone at the wheel, two for speeding in a 30mph area and one for no MOT. Some 17 verbal warnings were given to drivers. PCSO Sarah Trayhurn said police had carried out a number of educational operations in the past in partnership with the fire service, including highlighting the dangers of using a mobile phone at the wheel. “It is clear from feedback from the community, and this operation, that drivers are still continuing to break the law. “The majority of the people who were stopped by police were local people,” said PCSO Trayhurn. 0 comments Comments Welcome , please leave your message below.

Archant Police are appealing for help identifying a suspected burglar targeting homes in Exmouth. Police in Exmouth have released an Evofit image of man they would like to speak to in connection with a series of burglaries across East, South and Mid Devon. Officers said a home in Mount Pleasant Avenue, Exmouth, was burgled sometime between October 4 and 17, while the occupants were on holiday. Police said property stolen in the raid included a number of earrings, gold rings, a locket, a ladies wristwatch, a gold bangle and a service medal. A Devon and Cornwall police spokesperson said: “Police are investigating the possibility that the burglary is linked to an ongoing series of similar burglaries throughout Devon, and are keen to identify and trace an unknown man depicted in this EvoFit image, who was seen by witnesses in the area.” If you have information to help police, contact DC Carly Davies on 101 quoting crime reference CR/107364/14, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

About us Cookies Mobile Caron Lindsay on Morrissey Review Morrissey progress report Royal Mail: Vince vindicated 56% support fixed term parliaments Advert Opinion: The Lib Dem leadership’s attitude to the Police Commissioner elections is baffling! By David Hennigan | Tue 15th November 2011 - 2:15 pm Follow @DavidLHennigan Tweet “Liberal Democrats – soft on crime” was the headline that has often screamed off Labour leaflets over the last decade. Indeed, in the latter stages of the 2010 General Election, Labour strategists used that message to squeeze the Liberal Democrat vote when we were on 29%. Looking at the partial, last-minute collapse in our vote, it’s difficult to argue that this line of attack didn’t work. The ‘soft on crime’ attack was used against us in the Oldham East and Saddleworth By-election. Labour’s Christmas Card to constituents in Oldham even featured a snowman with a police hat on to illustrate their campaign. We did not effectively counter the police cuts message that Labour used as a major part of their campaign. Tony Blair was quite correct when he identified “crime and the fear of crime” as a key issue before New Labour’s 1997 landslide. Being tough on crime, or to be seen to be tough on crime, is a message that wins votes. Now, we all know Labour’s record on crime in 13 years of Government was lamentable. Coppers became pen-pushers as bureaucracy hit at all time high. During 13 years of a Labour Government, 3,600 new offences were created and a record number of people were incarcerated. It sounds good so far… Unfortunately, their record on rehabilitation was criminal. Under Labour, re-offending rates were a staggering 67% within two years of release from prison. Labour comprehensively failed to rehabilitate, instead turning our prisons into ‘crime schools.’ Now, Police Authorities across the country are suffering like many other organisations in times of austerity. I’d argue though that cuts in the policing budget are cuts too far. That said, the culture of waste in the police is similar to many other parts of the public sector. Take Greater Manchester Police for example. This Labour-run Police Authority have just spent £64m on a new HQ. They have wasted £100,000 on two pieces of artwork and spent £8,000 on importing trees from Italy to spruce up their HQ reception. At the same time, they are axing front desks at dozens of Police Stations across Greater Manchester. This is typical of Labour-run outside bodies in this country. November sees elections for the first ever Police Commissioners. It should be a key opportunity to tell people that we are a party which has the answers to deal with high crime rates and an unacceptable re-offending rate. Especially attractive is the Lib Dem policy that will see short-term prison sentences slashed and replaced with tougher community sentences. It is a fact that tougher community sentences drastically reduces repeat offending. Labour were on the right lines in government but like so much of their rhetoric simply did not follow it through. The Lib Dem Federal Executive’s rather lazy attitude to these elections — deciding not to provide any financial backing to Lib Dems wishing to stand for election, and instead back suitable independent candidates — is simply baffling. Yes, we may not have a huge amount of money sloshing through our party finances. What we do have though is the ability to fight and win on much-limited resources. I don’t want to sleepwalk into having someone like Hazel Blears in charge of all law and order issues in Greater Manchester. Make no mistake, by failing to take these elections seriously, we are abdicating the right to be taken seriously on law and order issues. We are playing into the hands of Labour’s message that we are ‘soft on crime.’ The decision is all the more baffling when you consider that it was Nick Clegg who was widely credited with moving the elections to November to take ‘politics’ out of it. Politics is the inevitable conclusion of what we signed up for in the Coalition Agreement. What we are effectively doing is handing over any influence to our political opponents. Do you think that the Labour and Conservative Parties will come to the same conclusion as our Federal Executive? I appreciate that the next few months will be hugely significant for our party. The London Mayoral election will soon be upon us. Ironically, we have an excellent candidate in Brian Paddick — himself an ex-copper. ‘Law and order’ will be on the menu for a significant part of the run-up to it. We as a party will be very well served by Brian as he will use his experience at the sharp end of policing to boost our campaign. I am sure that our party has many ex-police officers who would be ideally suited to be effective Police Commissioners. Our party is basically cutting the rug from under their feet. Image the uproar if the Federal Executive turned round and pulled any resources to the London Mayoral Campaign. I would ask the Federal Executive to look again at this decision and I would encourage potential Lib Dem candidates to go for it! * Dave Hennigan is a Lib Dem member in Macclesfield.

I can’t understand how the FE has ended up making a decision to fund independent candidates standing against Lib-Dems. If a member decided to do this in any other election, they would probably be expelled. Utter madness – I hope the FE thinks again. George W. Potter 15th Nov '11 - 3:36pm Hear hear. billgav 15th Nov '11 - 5:29pm Why do you assume waste only occurs in public sector it wasnt the public sector that crashed the economy .Anyone working in private sector can find many examples of waste and dodgy deals.The secret is to audit and audit again if you think electing police commissionerswill help think of MPs and their expenses James Gurling 15th Nov '11 - 5:44pm Just to reassure Lev – the FE did not decide to fund or back Independents against candidates of its own Party! Dale 15th Nov '11 - 6:05pm We should be saying its a waste of time and resource – the politicisation of the police is not something we should be seen to support (even if I would prefer a level headed liberal to a foaming at the mouth populist), standing would give that message… James Blanchard 15th Nov '11 - 6:13pm Completely agree with your article David. The party is shooting itself in the foot if this decision stands. I don’t hold out much hope for a change of heart though – I was at the discussion/consultation on this at Federal Conference, the idea of not standing was met with universal and strong condemnation by the audience, only for our opinions to be dismissed as ‘what you might expect from a room full of people who would come to this meeting’. Dave Hennigan 15th Nov '11 - 7:24pm Lev – I don’t think for a second that our party will be funding an ‘Independent’ candidates. George – It gives me no pleasure to criticise the FE in this manner. They have a difficult job to do but I strongly believe their decision in this whole episode sends out the wrong message and has just made the elections that bit more difficult. If they are that precious about politicising a Police Commissioner role then the time to stand up to that was during the Coalition negotiations. I know of someone who put himself through the approval process as a direct result of potential Police Commissioner elections. An ex-copper, he would have been brilliant – I still hope that he has a chance. billgav – At no point did I say that there wasn’t wastage in the private sector. Difference is, wanton waste in the public sector is taxpayer’s money. I gave the example of spending £100,000 on 2 pieces of artwork and £8,000 on importing trees whilst shutting front desks in Greater Manchester. Dale – As I stated, this was on the agenda at the time of the coalition discussions. I sincerely hope that this decision wasn’t made because of lack of ambition. I got told I was wasting my time spending time and money helping in Brent and Dunfermline. James – I am unsure what we can do about this decision – I hope we can do something. Tony Dawson 15th Nov '11 - 8:46pm “What we are effectively doing is handing over any influence to our political opponents.” This rather presupposes that these narcissists will have any influence at all. Personally, i believe that other than boring the pants off the Chief Constable for three or four hours per week and filling their own pockets with public money, they will achieve nothing. To agree to these elections in the Coalition agreement was a scandalous concession to the money-wasting tendency among the Tories. None of them heard the word ‘deficit’? Leekliberal 16th Nov '11 - 11:29am Dave Hennigan says ‘Yes, we may not have a huge amount of money sloshing through our party finances. What we do have though is the ability to fight and win on much-limited resources. ‘ Get the message Dave – Out in the sticks we don’t have ‘much-limited resources’ to fight in these unwanted Police Commissioner elections we have no money at all! With a deposit of £5000 and no Freepost to reach 1,000,000 electors in a typical county we couldn’t even afford to print the election address! We are good at maximising resources but we need some resources to maximise! I write as a Local Party Agent who has to live in the real world. Dave makes a good case for getting our voice heard but until the issue of cost is addressed by enthusuiasts for fighting them it’s all academic. Matthew Huntbach 16th Nov '11 - 11:44am There are good reasons why some posts are kept at a little distance from direct democracy. We recognised this when we made a big thing about our support for an independent rather than directly government controlled Bank of England. If elected Police Commissioners why not an elected Governor of the Bank of England? I mean this, it is not a rhetorical question, anyone who argues for directly elected Police Commissioners is, in my opinion, a hypocrite if they don’t also argue for a directly elected Governor of the Bank of England, or at least put up a very strong case as to why the principle of direct election should apply to one but not the other. I do believe there should be some democratic input into the police, but most certainly not through directly elected police commissioners. It is absolutely fundamental to the fair exercising of police power that this role is kept at arms-length from direct democracy, even of the form where it is controlled by an elected assembly, let alone the dubious (original word changed to see if that lets this message get through – what I posted first is now “awaiting moderation”) idea of one directly elected person. We should NOT support candidates for these roles and make it clear it is because we fundamentally disagree. Mostly I don’t agree with the idea of electoral boycotts, but here I think the very idea of this post is so fundamentally against our principles that we must just refuse to have any involvement with them.

Matthew Huntbach 16th Nov '11 - 11:51am There is a reason I posted three separate paragraphs as separate messages, but I am not allowed to say why. lloyd 16th Nov '11 - 12:48pm @Leekliberal I have been told there will be a freepost. However we don’t yet know if it will be a page in a booklet containing all the candidates or the same rules as the general/euro elections. Tony Dawson 16th Nov '11 - 12:59pm The trouble is with discussing certain things like this on a public forum is that occasionally people feel like they are just chatting with Lib Dems in a pub and say things which are inappropriate. You are chatting in a pub with millions of people, not all of them friendly, listening in avidly. Hywel 16th Nov '11 - 4:45pm Matthew – why do you support us standing in the London Mayoral election then? And is it so fundamentally against our principles. There has been political control of policing since – well forever. Police committees were originally composed primarily of local councillors and we campaigned against changes to police committees to reduce the influence of elected members. Aren’t things like a commitment to neighbourhood policing or prioritising resources to improve rape conviction rates, well, political decisions? Stephen Williams 16th Nov '11 - 5:21pm I don’t think this issue has been properly debated by MPs, unless I missed an important meeting! Most of us think the creation of the posts is a mistake, but they’re part of the Coalition Agreement so went along with it. It also makes me wonder what on earth is the point of 12 new city mayors, who will have no power to cut crime in their cities? Tony Dawson 16th Nov '11 - 6:39pm @stephen williams: “what on earth is the point of 12 new city mayors, who will have no power to cut crime in their cities?” It’s even worse than that, they don’t even know if this daft proposal is for cities or for ‘city regions’. Classic back-of-an-envelope populist nonsense. Matthew Huntbach 16th Nov '11 - 9:28pm Hywel Matthew – why do you support us standing in the London Mayoral election then? I wasn’t particularly happy about it, had there been a move to boycott mayoral elections I would have supported it. And is it so fundamentally against our principles. There has been political control of policing since – well forever. Police committees were originally composed primarily of local councillors There is a fundamental difference between power held collegially and power in the hands of one person. Plus, police committees had more of an advisory role, they did not have the direct control that a commissioner has. Hywel 16th Nov '11 - 11:01pm “There is a fundamental difference between power held collegially and power in the hands of one person. Plus, police committees had more of an advisory role, they did not have the direct control that a commissioner has.” We still contest elections when they are about putting the powers of collegiate body into the hands of one person (ie Mayoral elections). The argument is that these politicise policing. Do PCCs have any powers that either police authorities or the Secretary of State don’t currently have? It’s worth noting that the Explanatory Notes to the act state, “Subsections (5) to (7) set out the core functions of police and crime commissioners, which are to secure the maintenance of an efficient and effective police force, and to hold the chief constable to account for the exercise of his functions. These are the functions previously carried out by police authorities.” (though there are other functions in subsection 8) Stuart Mitchell 17th Nov '11 - 8:06am “Now, we all know Labour’s record on crime in 13 years of Government was lamentable.” Do we? Didn’t the British Crime Survey show massive drops in just about every category of crime between 1997 and 2010? “Unfortunately, their record on rehabilitation was criminal.” Actually the Ministry of Justice’s detailed figures (which go back to 2000) show reoffending rates falling significantly between then and 2009. So Labour, whether you care to admit it or not, actually gave us less crime, and less recidivism. Eighteen months of Lib Dems in power has already given us the largest prison population in history and the most shocking outbreak of mass criminality in living memory. I expect reoffending rates to rise as well given the data we’ve already seen from the August riots. I owuld suggest ou have a long, long way to go before you can claim to having the answers on law and order. “The decision is all the more baffling when you consider that it was Nick Clegg who was widely credited with moving the elections to November to take ‘politics’ out of it.” Clegg spent 25m of public money movig the electons purely to improve the Lib Dems’ electoral prospects. This is the first time I have seen anybody suggest he deserves “credit” for this! The really baffling thing about this article is that it’s supposed to be about police commissioners but ends up being all about sentencing and reoffending, two things which have little to do with police commissioners. Mick Taylor 17th Nov '11 - 9:18am Dave Hennigan is absolutely right. We have a strong message on law and order and the FE is simply abdicating its responsibility to make sure the party puts it across. Are we seriously going to let Labour and/or Conservative candidates in without giving them a fight? Worse still are we going to give the BNP and UKIP or a whole series of balmy independents free reign without challenge? I hope that the regional parties tell the FE just what to do with the crackpot decision! Nick O'Shea 17th Nov '11 - 9:32am I fail to understand what the party hopesto acheive with the no-show for elections to the Polcie & Crime Commissioners’ posts next November. Giving ‘independents’ (ie, in the south east at least, Tories by another name) a clear run not only leaves them more entrenched than ever, but denies us and the electorate an opportunity to have a real debate about crime reduction and prevention, how to rehabilitiate offenders and how to keep young people in particualr away from becoming petty criminals. Without Liberal Democrat voices in this debate, it will become a platform for the hanging and flogging brigade, with UKIP and the BNP providing accompaniment. How many times have ALDC and others said the way to beat these odious people is to fight them – not a stand aside and leave it to the Tories, Labour, and evern worse – so called ‘independents’. I am dismayed that the party seems to be erecting all sorts of barriers to stop proper Liberal Democrat candidates. If they did not want this to become “policital” tghey should not have ditched the passably reasonable system we have at the moment in favour of elections. What is a political party for if not to fight elections on its policies and principles in an attempt to elect people who will impliment our policies? Matthew Huntbach 17th Nov '11 - 10:00am Hywel We still contest elections when they are about putting the powers of collegiate body into the hands of one person (ie Mayoral elections). I think we should have made a very strong stand against that idea, which could perhaps have included boycotting mayoral elections. It is appalling the way the great and good have put forward this ideas as “devolving power” when all it means is that power which used to be held by a representative assembly is instead put solely into the hands of one person. The arguments used for this idea, that somehow it is more dynamic or modern or gets things going, or whatever – well, they were used for the same idea in various European countries in the 19290s and 1930s, “get the trans running on time etc”. Yes, that was what was the big idea back then, scrapping representative democracy and putting all power into the hands of one charismatic individual. Anyone who is a decent deep-down liberal ought to have been able to see this and so seen how dangerous this mania for directly elected executive mayors is, because it is the start of something very, very nasty and against what is fundamental to liberalism. The argument is that these politicise policing. Do PCCs have any powers that either police authorities or the Secretary of State don’t currently have? The Secretary of State is responsible to the assembly – Parliament – and ultimately can be forced to stand down by the assembly. So this is not the same as a directly elected official. PCCs are also an assembly. When it’s a specific task rather than a general task, direct election of one person is just not the liberal way to do it. The liberal way to do it is to have an appointed official who is a specialist in the task doing it directly, not a generalist politician with a party label, with the democratic oversight provided by a general assembly, responsible for many things not just that one and elected to be representative of the whole population, ultimately in control. Tony Dawson 17th Nov '11 - 1:54pm @mick taylor: “I hope that the regional parties tell the FE just what to do with the crackpot decision!” This would enable the constituencies to tell the Regional Parities what to do! @Hywel: ““Subsections (5) to (7) set out the core functions of police and crime commissioners, which are to secure the maintenance of an efficient and effective police force, and to hold the chief constable to account for the exercise of his functions.” Who wrote that meaningless drivel? A Chief Constable an carry on doing his/her duty equally well with or without a highly paid person, depriving them of three or four police constables’ worth of salary, considering that as their ‘brief’. Stephen Williams 17th Nov '11 - 7:39pm Tony – it was confirmed in the final stages of the Localism Bill that the mayors will NOT be for city regions. So no mayor for Merseyside or Greater Bristol. Hywel 17th Nov '11 - 11:32pm Matthew those are reasonable points against the idea of executive power being vested in one person. And I agree with you (indeed when working for ALDC I produced artwork packs for people campaigning for No votes in Mayoral referenda which I suspect you might have used in Lewisham). That is a good reason for opposing having PCCs at all – which we do. However that wasn’t really my point/question. It was about standing candidates. The argument is that PCCs politicise policing and this is something we shouldn’t do. For that argument to hold then PCCs must be given powers which don’t currently reside with political bodies. My argument is that this is a move of the political/democratic control of the police from the police authority committee (and Secretary of State) to a PCC. That isn’t politicising policing it is the moving of the political element of policing to a different person – and the explanatory notes to the act do seem to support this to some degree. My question is – what political powers will PCCs have that weren’t previously exerised “politically” – ie by the police authority or Secretary of State. jason 18th Nov '11 - 8:50am Stuart Mitchell.. Posted 17th November 2011 at 8:06 am I agree entirely. Sadly the LibDem ‘rump’ seems to spend more effort in repeating the Tory, “Since 1997 the country has gone to the dogs”, mantra instead of holding onto its core values; the values that made it the ONLY party with a soul. Matthew Huntbach 18th Nov '11 - 11:09pm Hywel indeed when working for ALDC I produced artwork packs for people campaigning for No votes in Mayoral referenda which I suspect you might have used in Lewisham I don’t think we did. The Labour leadership in LB Lewisham was pushing for the mayor system even before it became legal, and did what it could do introduce it informally several years before the legislation was passed to allow true “one man one vote” at local government level (that man being the mayor). When we were fighting it in Lewisham we were on our own, it was before the push for this sytem became more widespread and campaign material against started to be developed. It did NOT help that while we were fighting it, a pamphlet in favour of elected mayors written by a recently elected LibDem MP was pubished by CentreForum. That LibDem MP hadn’t bothered to ask his party colleagues in LB Lewisham about what was really happening there, but instead believed and regurgitated New Labour’s propaganda in favour of the system. Fortunately, no-one in New Labour in Lewisham picked up on that pamphlet, otherwise it could have seriously damaged us. The mayor system got through in the referendum, helped by the appallingly biased but supposedly “neutral” explanatory material produced and distributed by the council. But the nubers of people who approached me later, after it was in place and said “NOW I realise what you were on about, if only I’d known at the time, I would have voted No”.

Sam Byram of West Ham (Photo by Paul Gilham/Getty Images) The Champions League places may be just out of reach for West Ham, but manager Slaven Bilic is still targeting the top six as the season reaches it’s conclusion. The Hammers will look to win their last four games, beginning with West Brom at The Hawthorns tomorrow (Saturday), but despite the Baggies having nothing much to play for, he is expecting a tough fixture. “The top six is a target and has been for quite a while, though not at the beginning of the season,” said Bilic. “With four games to go we have a little bit of a gap, but we can’t afford to lose games or not win them. “It is going to be hard because we have four tough games and Liverpool are playing good, but we have had a good run and are fully motivated.” Jose Salomon Rondon, West Bromwich Albion. West Brom grabbed a surprise draw at title hopefuls Spurs on Monday night, and Bilic believes a Tony Pulis side will never relax in safety. “They are not on the beach,” he said. “It can happen, but a lot of the time teams are playing for pride or their futures. “Once when I played in Germany, we played the last game of the season and needed to win to get into Europe. We played a team, who like Aston Villa were already relegated, but they beat us 5-1. “Make no mistake, West Brom are going to be up for it, They have quality in the last third and they are safe with a cigar. It looks like they have never been troubled at all.” West Ham have certainly not been in trouble this season and a new report from former ref Keith Hackett suggests that if they had got all the decisions they deserved this season, they would be second behind Leicester with Spurs and Man United third and fourth. Does Bilic think that these decisions even themselves out? He smiles. “Well, not according to that table they don’t! It doesn’t even out, but it is part of the game and it is not only in England it is everywhere,” he said. “Barcelona weren’t given a penalty in their last game and the referee \u2028apologised and said he made a mistake. “In Turkey they have tried with two extra referees, but that doesn’t always work.” So what is Bilic’s solution? He added: “For me, there is no other option but technology, but only up to a limit You can’t be waiting for two or three minutes like in other sports. “Something like goal technology where you don’t even stop the game is good, but if it harms the flow of the game, I would rather have the mistakes.” Bilic has a fully-fit squad for tomorrow’s trip to the Black Country, but he is unlikely to make many changes from the team that won 3-1 against Watford at Upton Park. Right back Sam Byram played in the under-21’s Cup Final on Monday, but the manager seems keen to stick with winger Michail Antonio in that position. Both he and Dimitri Payet have looked a little tired in recent matches, but a week and a half of rest should see them return fresh and ready to go.

On Wednesday, a statement issued on behalf of Engavest, the mystery group of Swiss and Middle Eastern businessmen that took on Caterham from Fernandes in June, threatened legal action against the Malaysian entrepreneur. The consortium claimed there has been no transfer of shares that would make their ownership of the team legally binding. They have effectively washed their hands of the team, withdrawing the management that was in place, and informed Fernandes he is again in charge. Fernandes, owner of airline AirAsia and Barclays Premier League side QPR, has wasted little time in issuing a response. A statement issued on behalf of Fernandes and the Caterham Group, of which he is co-chairman, read: \"In June 2014, I decided, together with my co-shareholders, to sell my stake in the Caterham F1 team. \"We agreed in good faith to sell the shares to a Swiss company named 'Engavest' on the basis that Engavest undertook to pay all of the existing and future creditors, including the staff. \"The continued payment of staff and creditors was so important to me that I ensured the shares would not be transferred to the new buyers unless they complied with this condition. \"Sadly, Engavest has failed to comply with any of the conditions in the agreement and Caterham Sports Ltd (the UK operating company of the F1 team) has had to be put into administration by the bank, with large sums owing to numerous creditors. \"Our agreement with Engavest was very clear: there was no legal obligation to transfer the shares to them unless certain conditions - which included paying creditors - were met. \"Those conditions have not been met. Our lawyers have asked Engavest several times to comply with these conditions but they have failed to engage. \"If you agree to buy a business, you must pay its bills. \"They have breached that promise and now, sadly, it is others such as the employees and the fans of the Caterham F1 team that will suffer if the team ceases to race. \"I sincerely hope this will not be the case and a solution can be found.\" Former F1 team boss Colin Kolles, working as an advisor to Engavest, disputes Fernandes' remarks as he said: \"You have to understand this deal was done on full disclosure basis. \"All the conditions and precedents have been fulfilled by the buyer. \"We have our position, and there is nothing more to say. But the administrators, they are not seeing the clear picture.\" Caterham Group CEO Graham Macdonald, however, has questioned the ultimate ambitions of the Engavest consortium. \"It appears to me they never had any intention of paying these liabilities,\" he said. \"I go on to question how anyone who was interested in the long-term future of the business would appoint one of their cleaners - Constantin Cojocar - as the sole director and shareholder of the UK operating company? \"We continue to see claims and counter claims from the F1 team which are totally unfounded. \"Not only have they failed to pay the creditors - and have even left our shareholders to pay some of the creditors on their behalf - but they have failed to pay us anything for use of our factory and site, or anything for the use of our brand name. \"In short, the new owners have paid us nothing, and now the administrators have been appointed, they want to walk away from their liabilities.\" Behind the turmoil there are more than 200 staff at the Caterham F1 base in Leafield, Oxfordshire wondering whether they will be in a job beyond this weekend. With the administrator closing the doors on the factory on Thursday, the cars due to be used for next weekend's race in the United States have been impounded just 48 hours ahead of their scheduled flight to Austin, Texas. Kolles claims the cars belong to 1MRT, the F1 entry holder and company behind the team, and not Caterham Sports Ltd (CSL), who make and supply the cars and equipment. London-based accountancy firm Smith & Williamson disagree, which is why the doors to the factory have been closed and staff locked out. Kolles said: \"We say very clearly: the cars and equipment belong to 1MRT. This is a simple fact. This is how it is even written by Mr Fernandes in 2011. \"If the administrators think they have to stop it, and if they have a different opinion to it, then we have to go a legal way - which is damages.\" For now, it appears Caterham will not be lining up on the Circuit of the Americas grid in Austin. Kolles added: \"Everybody is prepared to go to Austin. The problem is if the administrators are not changing their mind it is difficult.\" Unsurprisingly, Engavest later issued their own statement in response to Fernandes and Macdonald, strongly refuting the allegations. The statement read: \"Every single condition precedent of the Sales and Purchase Agreement for which Engavest was responsible has been met. \"Only the seller, which includes Mr Fernandes, failed to meet his obligations. All salaries have been paid. \"Engavest sold CSL. It did not appoint Mr Cojocar who, we believe, was a former top footballer for Steaua Bucarest during the 1980s. \"The claims of Mr Fernandes and Mr Macdonald contradict their own press statement dated 03 October 2014 - 'Caterham Group wishes to clarify that, following the sale of the F1 business in July, it has no affiliation with Caterham F1 Team'. \"That one sentence alone contains two errors: 1, the date was June 29; 2, having failed to transfer the shares Caterham Group and Mr Fernandes wholly owned Caterham F1 at the time of the statement, as they do today.\" Comments (1) Please log in to enable comment sorting 6:18pm Thu 23 Oct 14 Cotswoldcrunch says...

Tweet Share 11 Comments Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. A delegation of Great Yarmouth businessmen is to meet local MP and government minister Brandon Lewis next Tuesday to spell out what they see as the devastating impact of the Government’s Deregulation Bill which would give schools across England the freedom to dictate the shape of their academic year. The bill, due to be discussed in the House of Lords next month, has been championed by former education secretary Michael Gove who wants to reduce summer holidays from six to four weeks and claims the education system is being handicapped by what he describes as a 19th century timetable. However, Visit Norfolk brand manager Pete Waters said the impact of the likely changes - moving two of the weeks to create longer breaks away from the summer - would be to send increasing numbers of domestic tourists abroad. “Families want to have their holidays in warm weather, something that cannot be guaranteed in England in October. The winners in this are going to be the airlines and foreign tourism destinations,” he said. Yarmouth Pleasure Beach boss Albert Jones, left, who employs 100 people in high season, said: “It will be the biggest challenge I have had to deal with in business if this bill goes ahead. “Around 50pc of our takings come during the six weeks in July and August. Taking away two of those weeks would be like telling shops they can only open so many days at Christmas. “No seaside business in Yarmouth would survive on four weeks of summer holiday trading. It would cost thousands of jobs and major tourist attractions like us would close.” Peter Jay, who runs the Hippodrome Circus, said: “We cannot operate anything on a four-week summer holiday; there would be no circus and the impact would be felt at resorts across the country.” Former Yarmouth Mayor Tony Smith, who runs the renowned Sarah’s Tearooms in Pleasure Beach Gardens, said: “Between 52pc and 55pc of my turnover comes in the six weeks - that’s 42 days out of the 175 days we are open. “The vast majority of seaside businesses would become marginal if these changes went ahead and it is already becoming harder and harder to maintain the status quo.” He voiced his concern that Yarmouth and other seaside towns would follow the fate of Margate in Kent where the seaside industry had already collapsed. Vice-chairman of Norfolk Tourist Attractions Association Peter Williamson, who has invested hundreds of thousands of pounds during his 10 years at Yarmouth’s Merrivale Model Village, said longer holidays outside the summer would not work for outdoor attractions - and he predicted it would send prices rocketing for families during the shorter school summer holiday. Mr Lewis confirmed he would be meeting local tourism leaders to learn about their concerns before the bill came back to the House of Commons. However, he said: “The Government has been putting power back in the hands of schools, moving away from Labour’s top-down approach to education. “The changes in the Deregulation Bill will allow schools to respond to the needs of their children and the preferences of their parents. Many schools have already used these powers to the benefit of their pupils. I think that it is important that schools have the power to deliver the most suitable educational timetable for their students to be best placed for the future.” Tweet Share Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. 11 comments Great Yarmouth should be put out of its misery. Add your comment | Report this comment norman hall Wednesday, September 17, 2014 I am currently in Valencia, Spain on a half board seven day break in a four star hotel.It cost me £370. Yet GYBC and the other rulers of the council being the touristy lot are scratching their heads as to why their 'lovely' town with it's parking fees is struggling?...... I think another foreign holiday is in order. Add your comment | Report this comment wes1975 Wednesday, September 17, 2014 Great Yarmouth is dying now, so to reduce the main season by 2 weeks and make the situation worse defies logic... This said the proposed 1000 houses to be built near the James Paget hospital will create more traffic and hospital A & E stress and problems... getting in and out of GY in the summer not good for businesses and tourists...if you increase the population beyond an acceptable limit for the services to cope with and lack of jobs many will suffer and be under pressure. I like shave ideas about GY seafront and amusement arcades are not one of them... GY needs something new and sort out the parking which looses many local trade .. from Gorleston and other areas... and Norwich benefits by such poor shopping in GY.. The Empire and Marketplace CO-OP Building shut for many years and the Britannia Pier shut 40 weeks a year .. must tell people something. No wonder tourist trade has dropped the past 20 years and guest houses going over the benefit claimers for all year round income. With people with little money to spend locally. Things to do on GY seafront in the evening in June and July is nothing....Even the fairground is shut.. School holidays in August is ok for the UK .. But going abroad can be far to HOT at 40c and too crowded to travel. if 4 weeks is reduced from 6 weeks the 2 weeks affected may not be summer weeks... which makes matter worse. all round.

A 4 week school summer holiday would make the already too-short British main holiday season too short to sustain funfairs, theatres, attractions. \"Do-gooers\" may want school terms of exact length etc. but the weather in this country isn't kind in October.

Add your comment | Report this comment DocScott Sunday, September 14, 2014 Gorleston Expat, I totally agree. Rather than moan about changing school holidays (a change which I feel is more beneficial for children's education) perhaps the local tourist industry should try and be a little more creative about its offering, which might in turn extend it's season. Unfortunately much of it is currently based around tacky shops selling overpriced cheap and nasty rubbish and amusement arcades, ie minimum effort for maximum return. It feels like there is very little attempt to provide any sort of quality, value for money holiday. There are a small number of nice eateries and one or two decent attractions such as the Time & Tide museum but they are in the minority. Add your comment | Report this comment Row71 Saturday, September 13, 2014 Lets turn this argument on its head..... Rather than a six-week summer holiday period being compressed into four; surely the converse is true? If schools are not forced to have their summer holidays betwen the last week of July and the beginning of September, would this not mean that many holiday makers could then take their holidays in June or at the beginning of July? The kids are still ging to get holidays, so this is a real opportunity for the season to be extended. The real challenge is for tourism-related business in Yarmouth to invest in providing visitors with a quality holiday-experience so they will stay longer, and come back more frequently. Add your comment | Report this comment Gorleston-Ex-Pat Saturday, September 13, 2014 Yarmouth's economy should not be based on tourism. It is a Victorian mindset and has held us back as a town for too long. We need to MAKE things. We need to generate our own wealth not be reliant on others charity for 6 weeks every year. Will there be casualties from moving towards this? Yes, but they should have diversified long ago. the archaic grip these cockle and whelk salesmen have over the running of this town is hilarious. Add your comment | Report this comment Steady On Wednesday, September 10, 2014 I don't understand why everyone is against the change to the school holidays, if you go by the standard of exam results these days and the standard of English and spelling these days, kids need more school rather than long holidays. Why is everyone worried about losing money if the six weeks is shortened, if the schools stagger the holidays between Spring and Autumn, the weather would be fine. Half Term at Easter could be lengthened and perhaps a week in May or June. Is there an underlying issue here that these businesses don't want to open for a longer time during the year. If Yarmouth didn't close half it's shops and attractions during what is 'off season', they might get more money coming in anyway, with so many places closed, no-one wants to come here. Open up the place.

TONY GAY at tonephote@aol.com THE FUTURE of youth clubs across the borough is at risk as Haringey Council announces plans to cut youth service spending by three quarters to save £2million. Tweet Share Comment Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. The youth service runs five youth centres across Haringey as well as providing support to the borough’s most vulnerable teenagers to prevent them moving into care or specialist schools. The service is used by 4,500 young people aged 13 to 19 and the savings will be made over the next two years as part of wider moves by Haringey Council to wipe £87million from its budget. But the impact of youth service cuts is likely to be felt immediately as £1,568,000 savings must be found in the next year alone, with £392,000 slashed from budgets the following year to save £1.96million by 2013. Teenagers from the Save Haringey Youth Centres campaign expressed “deepest disappointment” at the council’s decision. In an open letter to the council, they say: “It stuns us why we have not been able to enter an honest and transparent dialogue about your plans. “We may be young people most of us not of voting age, but we still deserve respect. “We have fought a hard campaign using your rules of democracy with our inexperience already leaving us at a disadvantage.” It adds: “We urge you not to play politics with the lives of young people in this borough.” But Haringey Council says it is working with the group to determine the future of services. Save Haringey Youth Centres campaigners have gathered a 2,200 signature petition opposing closures and met with London Mayor Boris Johnson as well as local MPs. A crunch meeting was held with the chief executive of Haringey Council last November - and the group say gang turf war rules about entering rival postcodes were even suspended for the day so as many teenagers as possible could attend. Haringey is now considering a range of options for reshaping the service - which may include deploying youth worker teams in the community rather than operating from centres and targeting services to the most vulnerable. Councillor Lorna Reith, deputy leader of the council and cabinet member for children and young people, said: “We haven’t taken final decisions on closures of youth centres. It’s possible that the future service might mean we just have one youth centre and do more outreach work. “We would run things not every night of the week but one night of the week, and nearer to where young people are and not at a centre. “That would save us the cost of running a centre and the postcode issue wouldn’t be such a problem for young people if we take the service to them.” She added: “We haven’t fully decided on the future shape of provision because we agreed with the Save Haringey Youth Centres campaign that we would do more consultation with young people before making final decisions.” She said better information about youth services run by an “enormous plethora” of voluntary groups, sports clubs, after-school clubs, and libraries should also be made available. Haringey Youth Centres There are five youth centres in the borough: * Bernie Grant Arts Centre in Tottenham (open two days a week) * Bruce Grove Youth Centre in Tottenham (open five days a week) * Muswell Hill Youth Centre in Muswell Hill (open five days a week) * Triangle Youth Centre in South Tottenham (open one day a week) * Wood Green Youth Centre in Wood Green (open five days a week) In 2009, there were activities one day a week at eight youth clubs: * Coldfall Youth Club in Muswell Hill * Campsbourne Youth Club in Hornsey * Tower Gardens Youth Club in Tottenham * Stroud Green Youth Club in Stroud Green * Hornsey Vale Youth Club in Hornsey * West Green Youth Club in South Tottenham * Shropshire Hall Media Project in Wood Green * Bounds Green Youth Club in Bounds Green Tweet Share Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. 2 comments The young people of Haringey have been betrayed! Does not being old enough to vote mean that they have no voice? They mounted a credible, intelligent campaign to maintain a vital service to the Borough, which has fallen on deaf ears. To propose to cut 75% from the budget for Youth is incredible, especially as 8 Youth Clubs have already been closed in the past year, so savings have already been made at their expense.. What is the point in young people having a Consultation meeting next week with their MP when the decision has already been made on their future (which is already looking grim). Wake up and smell the coffee Haringey, the young people are our future MPs, councillors and voters. The consequences of stripping this service to the bone at a time when the Haringey Safeguarding agenda is paramount is a tragedy unfolding. With the cessation of EMA and the prohibitive University fees already in place, what have an inner city Borough's young people got to look forward to? Not even a Youth Club where they can meet up and engage in positive activities in a safe environment. Whatever happened to Every Child Matters?

      "content":["bit-gamer.net bit-tech Gaming Blog Forums Search Blog Podcasts Gaming Columns Games I'd like to unplay Posted on 13th Dec 2012 at 09:06 by Antony Leather with 65 comments I had an interesting if slightly odd thought the other day. I like pondering about ‘what ifs’ and considering things like ‘what if this piece of hardware had been around 10 years ago?’ What difference would it have made? I realised that games are actually even more diverse than hardware when it comes to working and being good value for money or even enjoyable. Hardware generally tends to work. Yes, we’ve had a few prototype bits of silicon grace our lab over the years, not all of which worked, but generally, hardware does do its job, even if it’s not 100% efficient or particularly good value for money. However, some games we’ve played here at bit-tech have literally not worked. They’ve been so buggy or poor of lifeless that playing them was excruciating. On the flipside, some games have given me hundreds of hours of sheer awesomeness and the £30 I spent to own them is probably some of the best-value entertainment one could wish for. Click to enlarge These games made me feel good, sometimes awesome if I had a particularly good round in Battlefield. The bad games have made me want to do something else, even if that involved cleaning the floor of our lab with my tongue. With the good ones, many usually give a special moment than you remember for long afterwards as the defining moment in the game. It might be something to do with the graphics, or the gameplay or a particularly good storyline. It might even happen a few hours or even days into a game and not the first time you play it. Something happens that makes you think wow, that was epic. Sadly, these moments come and go in an instant, and while you might continue to have great moments of ownage, the wow factor you get when you play a good game for the first few times does fade while the memory lingers on. Likewise, you might have a game that was so poor, something in particular stuck out as being complete and utter fail. So, if you could ‘unplay’ a game to re-play those awesome moments, to have your mind wiped of those first experiences so you could bask in them all over again, or otherwise get your time and money back from that terrible game purchase, which games would they be? For me the most prominent good gaming moment was playing Battlefield 2. I’d been playing it for a few days when I stumbled into the enemy camp while bailing out of a chopper. Just as I thought the coast was clear to steal a jeep and get back in the game, I heard something that made me jump out of my skin. It turned out to be a Tunguska anti-aircraft vehicle having a pop at a jet overhead. The noise of its rapid-firing 30mm canons and the sheets of flame they spewed out made me curl up like a girl behind a wall till it moved off. Combined with the fact I was still in awe of the game’s graphics, it was an awesome moment that I’d love to relive again. Click to enlarge I've played a few poor games over the years, but Ship Simulator Extremes tops the lot. One moment in particular stood out as particularly bad; I ventured on a walk round the deck of a large ship, to be met with a hail storm of poor graphics and visual glitches that set my teeth on edge. Thankfully, I was reviewing the game at the time so I lost no money but I really feel for anyone that bought it. For good or bad reasons, which games would you unplay? Were there any epic win or fail moments that stood out? Let us know in the forum... Tags best games ever, worst games ever Share This Post | 65 Comments Discuss in the forums Reply XXAOSICXX 13th December 2012, 09:20 I'd like to unplay Brink...or, rather, I'd like to have actually been able to play Brink - but my £35 (and the final nail in the coffin for \"Game\") didn't actually get me a playable game because of game breaking audio problems. I'd have liked a refund too...but once linked to your Steam account that becomes somewhat problematic. I'd also like to be able to unplay Rainbow 6 Vegas 2, because my fond memories of the original Rainbow 6 were permanently tarnished by the piss-poor console port that is R6V2. Same goes for Far Cry 2. dr-strangelove 13th December 2012, 09:29 I'd love to unplay Portal - just so I could experience that 6 hour frenzy that was my first time playing it over again asura 13th December 2012, 09:34 Mission Humanity. Don't think there's any need to go further. Mister_Tad 13th December 2012, 09:37 I'd unplay all of the Bethesda RPGs and replay all of them apart from Fallout: New Vegas - the game completely broke for me about half way through, far enough to not want to repeat the first half, not far enough to feel like I'd had enough out of it. I'll throw Dragon Age II in there as well, probably my favourite recent-ish game, but isn't terribly re-playable after two times through. biojellywobbles 13th December 2012, 10:03 I'd like to unplay Fable 3 (I know, I know, its on a console) It completely ruined the franchise for me. I loved playing fable 1 and Fable 2 added a bit more even if it got rid of some of the more RPG like aspects. Fable 3 offered no way to truly customise the way you played the game due to the very linear way of upgrading skills. It also had very few decent side quests and didn't make me chuckle once, unlike the first one. [ZiiP] NaloaC 13th December 2012, 10:07 Medal of Honour Warfighter was rather abysmal. The mechanics of the multiplayer were good fun and the \"fireteam buddy\" system was very useful. However, it failed in so many other aspects. Horribly cluttered UI, not making good use of the Frostbite 2 engine, especially since the team sizes were limited. Could have been so much more, sadly it is just a generic shooter. I'm part of the other marmite crowd regarding Brink, I absolutely loved it. The mechanics were fantastic and the concept was quite well executed. It wasn't without it's unfortunate glaring flaws, but I think it was bold enough to try something new. For those that say the SMART system was pants, I say you didn't use it enough. Once you really got to grips with it, it was immensely fun. The level design needed some work, but overall the game really was a marmite affair. Oh well, I'd still like to see the concept/world expanded upon. fix-the-spade 13th December 2012, 10:24 I have a BF 2 moment too, specifically, the first time I moved in on a flag as part of a group. Moving a long, using a tank as cover, so far so like 1942. Gap in the wall, perfect spot for a ClaymoBANG! Blurred vision, all the sounds gone out and there's this ringing noise. I completely forget what I'm doing and dive against the wall. What the hell was that? Surely the tank must be in pieces all over the map? Nope, the tank's just fired it's gun. Welcome to Karkand noob. If I could unplay 40k: Firewarrior, that would be nice. I remember very little of that game except that it had noticeable controller lag that annoyed me so much I went all the way back to Game for a refund on the same day as I bought it... saxovtsmike 13th December 2012, 10:27 Monkey Island 1+2, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Day of the Tentacle.

I was replaying Zelda on the SNES a few months back and wondered how the hell I did it when I was 12-14! Griffter 13th December 2012, 11:06 want to unplay farcry 2's piece of crap! Harlequin 13th December 2012, 11:30 i want to unplay rage and delete it from my brain - it was aweful fodder 13th December 2012, 11:40 I would like to unplay all of the Call of Duty series and forks of it since they dropped dedicated servers. They have tarnished the memories of some epic online and single player games plus the best clan battles I have ever had. Poor gameplay, laggy, crap hit registration, inability to avoid/kick abusive players, an achievement system that would drive an ADHD sufferer to distraction and frustrating server browsing system. If I wanted a console game, I would buy a console. I game on PC because I prefer it so don't try and dress up a console game as being 'awesome' on a pc. It's not. edzieba 13th December 2012, 11:43 Ace Combat: Assault Horizon. It'd be like buying Portal 3, and discovering that it was actually a half-reskinned CODBLOPS with a few portals already attached to the environment, but not in areas you can access. sotu1 13th December 2012, 11:43 Quake wars and Diablo 3. The two most disappointing games I've ever played and also two of the games I most looked forward to. onominous 13th December 2012, 12:15 I would definitely unplay Diablo 3. I thought i'd give it ago, and found it terribly repetitive very early on, let alone doing the game through and through. I kept at it, as my friends wanted to play co-op to get through the hard difficulties..however after I got to Level 20 something, the epic shiteness of Blizzards system, me and 2 other friends got hacked and lost all our gear. Never touched the game again. Waste of 20 hours which could have been better spent doing uni coursework! Da_Rude_Baboon 13th December 2012, 12:28 Far Cry 2 Bioshock DreamCatcher 13th December 2012, 12:42 If everything goes as planned we'll have our annual private x-mas lan party again and I'll be able to enjoy the childish mischievousness when executing a sneak attack in C&C Generals, devastating a friends meticolously aranged base with an armed mob. Worst game experience ever: I can't remember the name of the game but it was from the DOS era. You were on a utterly unpopulated alien planet, wandering about a bleak landscape. Something happend to me and half the screen went black. It took me several ours to find out that I was attacked by a bird who picked one eye... need I say more? Bede 13th December 2012, 12:47 I would unplay my second time with Hexen II. In its day it was amazing, I absolutely loved it. Now it's not quite so special. Woodspoon 13th December 2012, 13:16 Far Cry 2, it destroyed my faith in games reviewers and big budget games, every turn it promised to \"get better in a minute\", it never did. krazykid035 13th December 2012, 13:20 Deadliest Catch for xbox....don't get me started!

Pete J 13th December 2012, 13:45 FEAR 3 was utter crap - I wish I could remove that from my brain. Since I couldn't stand to play Farcry 2 for more than a couple of hours I suppose it doesn't count. Ahh, there is Duke Nukem Forever as well... SubtleOne 13th December 2012, 13:54 Despite pretty nice production values, and being an indie to boot (which is why I hesitate to take a shot at it): Endless Space. It presents itself as a Galactic Civilizations II (which I loved), with nicer graphics, but ultimately bored me to tears as I insisted, forever convinced it wold improve. The vastly incomprehensible tech tree played a part, as did the dreadfully slow combat in which I continuously had no idea why one card was better than the next. Very very slow game. It is a big pity because visually it is very accomplished, and makes GalCiv2 seem almost amateurish in appearance. However GalCiv2 was an absolute ball to play, and this was incredibly dull. Instagib 13th December 2012, 13:59 Baulder's Gate 1. That was the first ever rpg game I ever played. In fact it was the first ever pc game I ever played. I fell in love and never looked back. Everything was new and emotional. I would unplay every single game I have ever played just to go back to that innocence. ev1lm1nd666 13th December 2012, 14:15 I'd love to forget most of the games I played on my trusty old Spectrum, FarCry Instinct Predator (Yes, On the Xbox 360), Bioshock 1 and 2 and all the Forza series so I can play them all over again as they all have a special place in my heart... I'd love to have never played FarCry 2, any of the Final Fantasy games and farm simulator as they are by far the worst games I have ever played in my life runadumb 13th December 2012, 14:19 Paper Mario the thousand year door. 30 hours i've wasted on that the last 2 months. I have finally said !NO MORE! Should have knocked it on the head many hours again. God damn waste of time that was. suragh 13th December 2012, 14:46 Pokemon Slizza 13th December 2012, 15:11 Quote: Originally Posted by Woodspoon Far Cry 2, it destroyed my faith in games reviewers and big budget games, every turn it promised to \"get better in a minute\", it never did. Go back and play it again. Took me a couple shots. But the game is brilliant. halfinched 13th December 2012, 15:47 My best gaming moment of the year came from xcom. moved all my units bar 1 into cover and set them to overwatch (thank god!) moved last unit to tree line on dash and activated a berserker. ARGH I thought as computer turn arrived. Berserker comes charging at my guy to pound his head into floor only for my entire team to pop their heads up in an awesome display of plasma and laser fire totally blowing the berserker apart. Even the low angle I got to see the charge and repelling fire added to it. I loved the game and then I loved it a little bit more. I'd like to unplay some of my dota 2 / lol games. It only takes a couple of idiots to make great games utterly excruciatingly painful. lilgoth89 13th December 2012, 15:57 Quote: Originally Posted by DreamCatcher If everything goes as planned we'll have our annual private x-mas lan party again and I'll be able to enjoy the childish mischievousness when executing a sneak attack in C&C Generals, devastating a friends meticolously aranged base with an armed mob. just out of interest how did you manage to get around the white background issue ? ive tried installing it on vista / windows 7 ( even in compatibility mode ) and almost all of the ground textures are white :( ) pbryanw 13th December 2012, 20:27 Half-life - the opening sequence is so ingrained in gaming history, so I'd like to experience it again for the first time. I'd also like to see the tentacle monster, experience being rushed by marines and taken in by the excellent (for the time) AI again. Though I'd end my play-through at Xen this time round. (Maybe it's time I tried Black Mesa?)

Sloth 13th December 2012, 21:25 Games to unplay so they can be played again: definitely Demon's and Dark Souls. All the surprises and mysteries would be great to experience all over again. Games to unplay from complete unenjoyment: Brink, and Pirates Vikings and Knights 2. Didn't enjoy either one in the slightest, despite friends loving them. MiNiMaL_FuSS 13th December 2012, 21:47 I'd like to unplay every COD after COD2, it went from decent WW2 balanced team game...to silly lone wolf crap for kids. omgdec 13th December 2012, 23:02 would love to take back the time and money i have invested in WoW. every CoD after Modern Warfare was pretty redundant too.. Bogomip 13th December 2012, 23:16 BEST MOMENT IN A GAME EVER: 1. Peggle - The Magic Hat and Flippers moment. If I could replay the time I got magic hat and flippers I would do it. That was ****ing awesome. Me and my housemate at the time were on a total high for days after, it was just. so. awesome. 2. WoW - Illidan Kill After a month or so of wiping, spending ages refining strategy, honing specific gear, getting everybody we needed on the same page - it was done. Just a perfect Multiplayer moment :) SubtleOne 13th December 2012, 23:27 Quote: Originally Posted by Bede Quote: Originally Posted by SubtleOne Despite pretty nice production values, and being an indie to boot (which is why I hesitate to take a shot at it): Endless Space.

I did get as far as the \"deathly dull nature of the endgame\", having stopped at the deadly dull middlegame. Looks like GC2 is still king. Whindog 13th December 2012, 23:35 FF7...I want to relive that game like it was the first time i saw it all the time. PLay it once every couple of years and its awesome, but to play it for the first time certainly gave you the this is epic feelings :D alex101 13th December 2012, 23:37 The opening 15 minutes of Crysis 1. I remember the graphics taking my breath away... and the fact that it's so peaceful and stealthy - and then the sun comes up and you meet Korean soldiers for the first time :D ashchap 14th December 2012, 12:58 I'd love to be completely new to EVE Online again, I don't play it these days, but I remember the excitement of discovering a new module or feature, the pain and adrenaline rush of my first death, and the moment when I got my first battleship. Now everything is old hat and I can never have that feeling again. GeorgeStorm 14th December 2012, 13:01 Would love to unplay KOTOR I & II so I could relive them. Especially KOTOR wit the restoration mod which I've heard rather good things about (will probably play it over Christmas) The stories were just so good. Also +1 for the opening on Crysis, epic stuff. Lazarus Dark 14th December 2012, 13:05 Any/Every Zelda. I don't remember the first time I played most games, but I can vividly recall the excitement of the first play of each and every new Zelda game, I can remember how old I was, what was going on, what snacks I was eating and who I was playing with. Chris_Waddle 14th December 2012, 13:37 For me, in the way you would like to unplay BF2, I would love to unplay Elite on the BBC micro. When you first leave the space station and can fly in a \"3D\" field and then your first battle against pirates was gobsmacking. This just hadn't been seen before and for me is an experience I will never forget. I for a game I wish I had never played; COD Modern Warfare II. I just hated this - talk about zero lack of originallity. According to steam I have played under 5hrs (and completed the singleplayer) and a grand total of zero seconds on the multiplayer. capmoq 14th December 2012, 13:46 Red Alert 3 Command & Conquer 4 Devil May Cry 2 World of Warcraft stonedScientist 14th December 2012, 15:48 Would love to unplay DoD. And to a certain extent CS. Although it wasn't fun being a noob in CS. But the addiction to gaming I got from CS was like no other. Unbelievable. rollo 14th December 2012, 16:11 I'd like to unplay wow, I'd ge back in excess of £700 + 2-3 years of my time. That was 1 addicitive game. d_stilgar 14th December 2012, 20:37 Quote: Originally Posted by XXAOSICXX I'd like to unplay Brink...or, rather, I'd like to have actually been able to play Brink.

Go back and play it again. Took me a couple shots. But the game is brilliant. I did try it again, several times about six months apart each time and it was still painful. Promises so much, but it just never happens and knowing how reviewers raved about it just seems to make it even worse. Elton 15th December 2012, 00:45 Morrowind. Dear god I'll never see light again. I'll also defend Far Cry 2. The game suffered from some terrible design decisions that seemed to have been implemented in the last minute. The respawns and the kevlar skin issue seems like an easily remediable issue. The game is in fact stunning and there is quite a bit to love about it. The only problem is trawling through what probably is the most disappointing thing because of the massive amount of potential it contains. And that's the sad part, Ubisoft's been locking out modders for years now, and they really shouldn't. Most of their games would benefit heavily from just a few simple mechanics tweaks. Star*Dagger 17th December 2012, 02:49 Not so much unplay Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 as delete it from the history of humankind. There were better games, with much better engines. Like Shattered Horizon. LOL Lockinvar 17th December 2012, 08:03 Unplay and get my money back: Deus Ex: Human Revolution I'd also like to unplay Diablo 3 if it wasn't for the $1000 or so I made selling all my stuff when I finally decided the game did indeed suck badly. What I'd like to have over again, is a hard thing to say, because often those experiences were specific to the time period, especially so in regards to graphics - but I'd definitely say: Diablo 1 Red Dead Redemption FTL Hamfunk 17th December 2012, 16:01 Unplay and remove from steam and my memory: Borderlands Bioshock Homefront MoH: Warfighter Showerhead 17th December 2012, 17:52 Unplay Fallout 3 and leave New Vegas as the sequel. It just fits in far better into the story of the series. Play Fallout 3 later but just rename it wasteland or something since is rather disconnected from the rest of the series.

Warhammer something or other..

I kept playing it thinking it has to get better soon. GeorgeStorm 1st January 2013, 11:37 Would like to be able to unplay Metroo 2033, so I could reply it on ranger without knowing any of the story. Great game. ZatOichi 8th January 2013, 15:30 SPORE The_Crapman 8th January 2013, 15:48 I'd like to unplay dangeon defenders. loved that game till they introduced sharkens that ruined any chance of me completing it on nightmare. the best part was working out the best tower configurations and fine tuning them, now i just know where stuff should go. LightningPete 15th July 2013, 14:28 The fact that ''EXTREME'' can be put with SHIP SIMULATOR in the same title is pretty much a killer before it was bought. However i would never want to unplay ANY game. Simply put the bad gaming experiences were the ones that made me enjoy the better ones more, by simply comparing them in my mind or becoming more excited at a title that came after a pretty horrendous one.

News & Star News & Star Carlisle United Match reports Carlisle United's shaming at Shrewsbury Last updated at 15:26, Wednesday, 17 September 2014 Shrewsbury 1 Carlisle 0: Those at the top of Carlisle United are obliged to sort out this disarray without another momentâ€™s delay. This should be the last game under caretaker management; the final, empty slump before a new era. Have your say When you think if the great players and managers we have had and how we have punched above our weight for mist of the last 50 years now with concern this could be the end. No way back in the short term from the conference. To many good teams at that level now. How has this happened, Abbott, Kav are much to blame or those that appointed them. An experienced manager there are loads let's hope Keith Curle was scouting for a premier league team about to pay Ã‚Â£1m for one our players and not as is being suggested in the melting pot as the next manager. Ward was to blame for Bristol Rovers decline so he has the experience to do that again! Posted by Mal on 17 September 2014 at 14:09 Who in their right mind would buy United. It's not a going concern and in the modern world of football is never likely to be fully solvent. As for those who say sell it or put money in why don't you say to your wife by the way I'm away to spend what savings we have on a football club. The club is probably the least attractive proposition to buy in the football league. Posted by Anon on 17 September 2014 at 13:59 Tony Caig who is the Trainer & Coach should resign Posted by paul on 17 September 2014 at 13:56 This will never get sorted until the Board go. Andrew Jenkins a gentleman with a good business but sadly when it comes to football .......... Well who was in charge before Knighton yes Andrew and look where we were then and where we are now? The lack of ambition in fact no ambition at all just to stay in the league is just not good enough if the board has a defetist attitude it will run right through the club. I can't see Fred ever wanting to come back so until we find someone to come in I can only see us back in non league football where I would think we could be there forever. Posted by Pete on 17 September 2014 at 13:50 MELTDOWN. Great headline. However, since these three Directors came to power the club has been on a steady decline. It really has reached a point where we should be stood outside demanding a change of ownership. I firmly believe that they should all be banned for life if new owners could be found. It's unbelievable how they prattle on about a new ground when it the club that's crumbling around them and it's THEM that are making it crumble. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. put the club up for sale and advertise the fact. Then sell up, you've had interest we know it and they know it. It's just that they like there noses in the trough. No sorry there trotters too. All at the fans expense. SCANDALOUS! They are making Knighton look good. Posted by Don Lingard on 17 September 2014 at 13:40 Watched last night's game from my elevated position with the view of the game that was shared with Keith Curle and John Ward. On last night's performance alone, the current Carlisle squad would find it difficult to survive in the Conference Premier let alone survive League Two. Understandably, self belief and self confidence in the Carlisle team was very low and often play seemed rushed and lacked control as a draw was desperately sought, but the sad fact remains that the management of this club has allowed this situation to develop over a number of years.Some of us supporters have felt for some time, that there lacked a coherence about how the club should develop. A lot has been demanded from far too many young footballers who need to gain more experience so that they can play with confidence and to make the right strategic decisions during play. Whoever is successful in becoming the next manager their task is a daunting one... maybe more than Keith or John could stomach. Posted by Dave Burton on 17 September 2014 at 13:34 So very depressing to see. Aliens couldn't help us out now... Posted by Michael Knighton on 17 September 2014 at 13:31 Supporters must accept financial reality, which suggests that resurgence will only be possible under new ownership as well as new management. As to the latter, it is worrying to read that John Ward was in attendance last evening. Not again, please: however desperate the situation, kick and hope is not the answer. Posted by Derek on 17 September 2014 at 13:30 Greg Abbot with Graham Kavanagh a good combination.should have been retained. Posted by tom crotty on 17 September 2014 at 13:24 Steve Lomas would be a great appointment if McDonald isn't interested. He must have some good contacts, a decent record with an unfashionable club in Scotland, harshly shoved from Millwall and played at a high level too. Seems to come across in interviews well so hopefully can get his ideas forward to the lads too.

Reports that a trail of destruction had been left through Flaybrick Hill – now Flaybrick Memorial Gardens – on Tollemache Road, Claughton, came in to police on May 23. It is believed more than 100 gravestones and memorials were badly damaged the previous night at the historic site, which opened in 1864 and ceased as an active cemetery in 1975. Two of the headstones that have been damaged A 10-year-old boy from Birkenhead was arrested in June initially on suspicion of criminal damage and theft in connection with the incident. He has now been charged with theft and has been bailed to appear before Wirral youth court on September 2. It is understood the urn has never been recovered by police. Two other boys, a 15-year-old and a 13-year-old from Prenton, were also arrested on suspicion of criminal damage earlier in the investigation and both remain on police bail until next month. The site, now a memorial gardens within the Flaybrick Cemetery Conservation Area, is no longer used for burials or the interment of ashes except for within existing family plots. Watch video of the damage done back in May: Video loading Repair work on the damaged gravestones is currently being carried out by the council and is set to take several months to complete. Following the vandalism, George Dodd, from Prenton, told the ECHO of his disgust at the state he found the site in after going to visit a family plot at the cemetery. He said: “I went down to visit the grave for my grandfather, grandmother and two sisters, who both died young aged five and one. “As I walked into the part where my family’s grave is you could see almost all the gravestones had been toppled over. “The gravestone I was looking for was actually one of the few left standing. “It was very upsetting, the state of the place was disgusting.” More than 100 graves vandalised in Flaybrick Cemetery Wirral council staff have been contacting relatives affected, though some of the graves are so old no living family members have been found. Last month a group of caring youngsters volunteered to help clean the cemetery, litter picking and clearing overgrown areas to allow staff to concentrate on the repairs to the graves themselves. Nic Harding, ranger and forest school leader for Wirral council, said at the time: “We’re still reeling from the fact this has been done. It’s a long, drawn-out process which will take several months to bring it back to how it was before. “The ones we can stand up we will, those that are too badly smashed will be laid out in their rightful place. “I expected that people would be distressed by the vandalism but I was really gladdened by these young people, so enthusiastically defending their heritage and willing to come and help.”   Follow @WirralNews What's on tonight?   Find things to do near you that you'll love Most Recent in News Wirral Council ‘Friends’ group handed keys to kennels News @wuthnhs colum 17/12/14 News Fire and Rescue Service column 17/12/14 Frank Field MP Column 17/12/14: Frank Field Esther McVey MP Column 17/12/14: Esther McVey Tranmere Rovers   All the latest news from Prenton Park BuySell   Buy & sell items including cars and houses, or browse thousands of ads.

The Scottish Grand National was first contested over 127 years ago and has been held at Ayr Racecourse since 1966 after the original Bogside course closed down. Racing began there in 1808, and the West of Scotland Grand National was introduced in 1867. In some ways it was remarkable that racing continued as long as it did, for there were several things Bogside didn’t have going for it. For a start, it was sited in an awkward spot, sandwiched between the railway and the rivers Garnock and Irvine. A heap of shale on the infield blocked off the view for most of the track and for most of the spectators. The sandhills on the far side of the course meant there was never any room for expansion. It took until the 1970 for the track to be fully enclosed by running rails. Until that time, it was not uncommon for a loose horse to make its way over the sand dunes and swim out into the estuary. Then there were the fences themselves. The right-handed, two-mile circuit had the usual mix, with nine plain fences, two open ditches and a water jump. Just as at Aintree, there was a long run in of 370 yards, on which horses passed a plain fence and the water jump. But there was little to help a horse find its place at the jumps. With all those challenges, it’s perhaps no surprise that in 1963 the Levy Board included Bogside in its list of 12 racecourses which it would no long support financially. They reckoned that Bogside would need £80,000 spending on it to bring the facilities up to a reasonable standard. And so racing came to an end there, on 10 April 1965, although point-to-point meetings continued until 1994. The Scottish Grand National is a very popular race. It’s always a surprise to note that over the years the race has produced many close finishes, despite it being run over four miles and one furlong. This weekend’s showpiece has another massive Irish presence to it. Rogue Angel is set to form part of a very strong Irish raiding party at the weekend which also includes at the six-day stage current favourite Cause Of Causes, Tony Martin’s Heathfield and the Willie Mullins-trained Measureofmydreams. Paul Nicholls could run Southfield Theatre, Vincente, Benvolio and Vivaldi Collonges as he looks to retain his trainers’ title while Nicky Henderson’s Vyta Du Roc is another leading contender. Sausalito Sunrise looks set to carry top weight following the expected defections of Many Clouds and The Last Samuri which means Philip Hobbs’ charge is topping the list and a rise in the weights of 7lb will follow. Seeyouatmidnight has been left in by Sandy Thomson after coming up short in the RSA Chase but will be suited by the marathon trip.

Enter the above word in the box below Report comment Boost for Christmas homeless appeal Southend campus student Louise Turner share on Facebook share on Twitter share on Google+ email (8) comments print First published in News by Paul Nizinskyj STUDENTS have been doing their bit to help a homeless charity, aiming to provide 1,000 Christmas dinners for people out on the streets. Art and design students at South Essex College used the Southend campus’s giant screen to highlight Harp’s Christmas Meal Appeal. The display involves 82 students, each of whom appears on the screen with a food item they are donating to the Echo-backed appeal. The screen can be seen by hundreds of people every day, so the students decided it would be an ideal way to help the appeal. Student Jess Monk, 18, said: “As the charity is local to Southend, we can actually see how we’re helping to make a difference.” Course leader Dan Fardell added: “We wanted to make people aware of this big problem, as not everyone can afford to have a luxurious Christmas. “Some people are living on the streets and we want to help them in any way we can.” Harp’s volunteering manager Tony Dunn said the charity was immensely grateful for the students’ support. He added: “It’s fantastic, in terms of food donations and of helping to increase our profile and widen our support base in the area.” The college’s Basildon, Southend and Thurrock sites also took part in Christmas Jumper Day, in support of those less fortunate over the festive season, raising money for Save the Children and collecting supplies for local food banks. Principal Angela O’Donoghue said: “Christmas is a joyous time for many to spend with their friends and family, but sadly, it can be an extremely difficult time for those in need. “It is times such as this our students and staff really show their generous side and do what they can to help others less fortunate.” Comments (8) Please log in to enable comment sorting Log in or Register to get comment alerts.

There was only a light southwesterly wind and sunny skies, but the riders had to take it easy on the corners due to slippy roads. A few riders said it felt a sticky outleg with a fastish return, with most riders finding their feet in the first long-distance event of the calendar. It was a great effort from Steve Dodds as the only rider to break the hour and take the win, followed by Stewart Pickard, closely followed by Martin Cockerill for third. The novice bowl was won by a new young Paragon member Ben Thompson, with a great effort for the distance, in only his second attempt at it. Results as follows: (Paragon unless stated) 1 Steve Dodds 58.50, 2 Stewart Pickard (Team Vive Le Velo)1.00.04, 3 Martin Cockerill (Bridlington CC) 1.01.16, 4 Rob Corney 1.02.58, 5 Kevin Allen 1.03.01, 6 Karl Williamson 1.03.58, 7 Chris Brown (RCC) 1.05.05, 8 Chris Goode (YCC) 1.10.39.9, Ben Thompson 1.12.00, 10 Barrie Cappleman 1.13.48, 11 Jimmy Morrison 1.17.02. A big thanks go to timekeeper Rob Corney and to John Tillotson and Brian Ward for helping on such a cold day. Paragon riders held their second event, a 15-mile time-trial,three laps of the Yedingham circuit. It was a cool, overcast morning that greeted the field of 23 riders, the rain had made the roads wet and a lot of the field took caution on the corners,not wanting to come off, but thankfully there was little wind. It was a close run at the sharp end of the field with in-form YHT/SRC rider Bob Hewitt again just beating Paragon veteran Dodds into second place by 13 seconds with Vive Le Velo veteran Stewart Pickard in third place with a great time of 35.14. The ride of the day went to Kevin Allen, who was extremely pleased to gain a personal best by one and a half minutes, putting him sixth overall, this done on his new bike. Paragon rider results:1 Steve Dodds 34.01, 2 Karl Williamson 36.30, 3 Kevin Allen 36.35, 4.Nev Watson 37.21, 5 Simon Ward 37.41, 6 Tony Tennyson 38.58, 7 Rob Grainger 39.04, 8 Mike Potter 41.19, 9 Barrie Cappleman 44.36,10 Jimmy Morrison 44.55, 11 Hannah Bayes (16 years old) 45.53,12. Brian Ward (81 years old) 49.17. Guest/second claim riders: Bob Hewitt (YHT/SRC) 33.48, Stewart Pickard (Vive Le Velo) 35.14, Martin Cockerill (Brid CC) 35.29, Paul Hickman (Malton Wheelers) 37.11, Dave Leaming (YHT/SRC) 37.15, Steve Norris (YHT/SRC) 39.19, Chris Goode (Yorks Coast Clarion) 40.37, Louise Scupham (Team Jadan) 40.43 (with puncture), Colin Baldwin (YHT/SRC) 41.06.

Cumberland News My word, what a line-up RNorris Published at 00:00, Thursday, 05 January 2006 RENOWNED singer-songwriter Michael Chapman is playing a gig for charity at Bewcastle on Saturday, January 28. The concert at Stones Barn, in aid of Cancer Research UK, will celebrate Chapmanâ€™s 65th birthday and 40 years on the road. Chapman played a sell-out gig with Maddy Prior at Stones Barn last year. It is very much a local venue for the musician, who lives at Greenhead. As his 65th birthday approaches Chapman shows no sign of slowing down. In 2005 he released his 27th album and toured Austria, Holland, the USA and Canada. The Bewcastle gig is part of his Bus Pass Tour. Other venues include Scarborough, which inspired one of his best-known songs, Postcards of Scarborough. Chapmanâ€™s guitar and voice first became known on the late-1960s folk circuit. His atmospheric autobiographical material established his reputation for intensity and innovation. He recorded a quartet of classic albums for EMI, mixing intricate guitar instrumentals with a full band sound. Fully Qualified Survivor, which featured Mick Ronson on guitar and Rick (Steeleye Span) Kempâ€™s bass, was John Peelâ€™s favourite album of 1970. Chapman played regular sessions on Radio One during the 1970s and BBC TV broadcast two Chapman Band performances. In the 1980s he toured with Rick Kemp and his recent records have enjoyed critical acclaim in music magazines Q and Mojo. The concert begins at 8pm. Tickets are Â£10 and are available by calling 016977 47571. TICKETS are now on sale for the 2006 Keswick Words by the Water literary festival at the Theatre by the Lake. The speakers include Princess Michael of Kent and film star turned director Richard E Grant. Other star names are jazz musician George Melly, Mastermind legend Magnus Magnusson, poet Roger McGough and political commentators Anthony Howard, Jon Snow, Tony Benn and Edna Healey, plus Keswick regulars Kate Adie, Michael Buerk and Joan Bakewell. The festival runs from March 10 to 19. For ticket and schedule information call 017687 74411. THE Wordsworth Trustâ€™s weekend arts and book festival takes place in Grasmere on the weekend of January 20-22. The annual festival is a course of lectures and workshops at the Prince of Wales Hotel. For information about residential or non-residential attendance call 015394 35544 or e-mail bookfestival@wordsworth.org.uk THE Occasional Rascuedos are back in the UK and heading for Dumfries after a successful tour in the USA. Their six-date tour of New York was extended by two last-minute gigs, one of which was at the Tuxedo Junction in Danbury. During the trip the band shot lots of video footage which they have compiled into a DVD and will be used for promotional purposes. They make their debut visit to The Venue in Dumfries on Friday, January 27, starting at 8pm with support band Wildcard.

Police say the deaths were discovered within half an hour of each other, but were not linked and or suspicious. Police have confirmed two men were found dead in Exmouth on Tuesday morning in unrelated incidents. Officers said the bodies of the men – both aged in their 40s - were discovered within half an hour of each other. A man in his 40s, named locally as Wayne Chalmers, was found dead at a property in Pound Lane, Brixington, at around 8.50am. Police had received a call with concerns for Mr Chalmers’ welfare. Devon and Cornwall police said the emergency services were called and Mr Chalmers, who has a garage at Pound Lane, was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said officers were not treating the death as suspicious, next of kin were being notified and a file was being prepared for the coroner. Half an hour earlier, at around 8.25am, police were called to the East Devon District Council yard at Camperdown Terrace car park, after a man was found by a member of the public. He has not been named but is believed to be a dad-of-three from Exmouth. Police and ambulance crews attended, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene. Officers say they are not treating the death as suspicious and are preparing a file for the coroner.

Until his gaze flicked up causing me to nonchalantly drift my eyes away and pretend I was just glaring at everything in the carriage like a normal person and not just him, I had been transfixed by whatever it was that he was playing because of one simple fact: I had no idea what it was. If you are at all plugged into the games industry, it's rare that you are surprised by any new releases. Even with the indie scene, a lot of the more significant and interesting titles generate enough pre-release hype that although they may be innovative or unusual in some way, you're still not exactly surprised by them. This was different though. It's not that the title looked particularly enjoyable, or even terribly well polished, it was just that there was absolutely no recognition of any of the artwork or style of game. Not only had I no idea what the title was called, I would have been unable to give a rough guess of the developer and actually a little hard-pressed to reliably tie it down to a particular genre. It's not the first time this has happened at all. Being nosey and glancing at what people play on their phones will a third of the time reveal Angry Birds, a third of the time Solitaire and a third of the time something completely unrecognisable. Birds, cards, or potential madness It's easy to see why this is the case. There is a daily deluge of games unleashed onto the Apple Appstore and Google Play, making it impossible to keep up with everything. A couple of news outlets make a valiant outlet, but there is a never-ending quagmire of games freely or cheaply available, catering to the many weird and wonderful tastes of your average smartphone owner. The scenario reminds me of a simpler time in gaming, a time before the internet where a handful of titles were marketed incredibly hard with the rest left to be spread gradually through word of mouth among peer groups, or were quite simply found in a shop and bought on the off-chance it would be ok. The iOS and Android markets inspire a sense of nostalgia, not in their wares but in the system itself. They encourage discovery and give you the chance to uncover hidden gems. The Appstore reminds me of going to visit my Amiga-owning friend and being introduced to games I'd never seen before and would quite likely never see again. It's impossible to go back to that time before everyone knew everything, and even if it were possible, it would be a bad idea. The gaming collective having a persistent always-on knowledge of what is out and what is going to be imminently released is the lifeblood of the industry and to remove that would be to see everyone on all sides of the equation suffer. However, seeing this completely unknown game being played by a complete stranger on the train made me want to branch out of my comfort zone a little more and explore the gaming unknown. Be it the mobile gaming markets or the less mainstream end of the indie scene, the next Minecraft analogue that nobody has played yet is out there and I want to find it.

On iOS, the latest game I found was Splice, it's somewhat odd but novel which it is quite good. Sworcery on iOS is quite good too, it is a bit strange but nothing looks like it and it manages to create a little world of its own. It's nice to see a renewal in the game industry, where it's not all about racing, RPG or FPS... Jezcentral 12th September 2012, 08:55 Blimey, buying games based purely on the box? I remember doing that. It was 1993, and the game was Legacy by Microprose. It wasn't great, but UFO: Enemy Unknown was, as was Master of Orion, Civilisation, Master of Magic, F117-A and F19 Stealth Fighter. The early nineties were great, and Microprose was a great developer/publisher.

Zool Saivert 12th September 2012, 10:23 I would be playing more Android games if it wasn't for the fact that most games do not support my Samsung Galaxy Ace even though its processor is more than capable of playing anything purely 2D based. Forget 3D. Most games are 2D anyways. I do no understand why the Play store says my phone is not supported when it really would be able to run a title without much effort. Something seriously fishy going on. mi1ez 12th September 2012, 12:37 Quote: Originally Posted by blacko I bought a game because of the box.... Zool Classic!

I remember doing that way back too. Back when you could because games weren't so outrageously overpriced. It wasn't much dropping $20 on a game even if it turned out to be crap. I'm not dropping $65+ on the chance I might like a game. Those were the good ol days, I got quite a few games back then, games I would have never played but I picked them up because the box/description/pictures looked good and they were cheap. I remember I bought Warsong/Langrisser for the Genesis for $19.99 back in '91 or so, just because of the box, and I was just recently playing it again a couple months ago. Now that's value... Sorry, nostalgia got to me. Gunsmith 12th September 2012, 19:16 i don't understand this fascination of gaming on a phone.

Sloth 12th September 2012, 21:31 I'm sure plenty of people have their memories of before this time, but it never ceases to amaze me how all of the games I played as a kid (N64, PS1, GBA, etc) are so commonly available in used games shops. Compared to today there weren't nearly as many games! A thrift shop, not even a dedicate games store mind, had almost all of my cherished N64 collection in their used game stock! And some of there weren't exactly big hits, there just weren't as many titles so even the obscure games pop up. Now my Steam collection over the last five years has almost grown larger than my childhood games collection counting all consoles combined and that's still just a fraction of the games out there! It's magical and frightening at the same time. Quote: Originally Posted by Gunsmith i don't understand this fascination of gaming on a phone. Neither do I. I still have yet to install a game on my Galaxy Nexus, doubt I ever will. Makes for some funny moments, though. People will mention popular mobile games and when I have no idea what they're talking about will assume I'm not into gaming! Couldn't be farther from the truth!

Tweet Share 11 Comments Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. A delegation of Great Yarmouth businessmen is to meet local MP and government minister Brandon Lewis next Tuesday to spell out what they see as the devastating impact of the Government’s Deregulation Bill which would give schools across England the freedom to dictate the shape of their academic year. The bill, due to be discussed in the House of Lords next month, has been championed by former education secretary Michael Gove who wants to reduce summer holidays from six to four weeks and claims the education system is being handicapped by what he describes as a 19th century timetable. However, Visit Norfolk brand manager Pete Waters said the impact of the likely changes - moving two of the weeks to create longer breaks away from the summer - would be to send increasing numbers of domestic tourists abroad. “Families want to have their holidays in warm weather, something that cannot be guaranteed in England in October. The winners in this are going to be the airlines and foreign tourism destinations,” he said. Yarmouth Pleasure Beach boss Albert Jones, left, who employs 100 people in high season, said: “It will be the biggest challenge I have had to deal with in business if this bill goes ahead. “Around 50pc of our takings come during the six weeks in July and August. Taking away two of those weeks would be like telling shops they can only open so many days at Christmas. “No seaside business in Yarmouth would survive on four weeks of summer holiday trading. It would cost thousands of jobs and major tourist attractions like us would close.” Peter Jay, who runs the Hippodrome Circus, said: “We cannot operate anything on a four-week summer holiday; there would be no circus and the impact would be felt at resorts across the country.” Former Yarmouth Mayor Tony Smith, who runs the renowned Sarah’s Tearooms in Pleasure Beach Gardens, said: “Between 52pc and 55pc of my turnover comes in the six weeks - that’s 42 days out of the 175 days we are open. “The vast majority of seaside businesses would become marginal if these changes went ahead and it is already becoming harder and harder to maintain the status quo.” He voiced his concern that Yarmouth and other seaside towns would follow the fate of Margate in Kent where the seaside industry had already collapsed. Vice-chairman of Norfolk Tourist Attractions Association Peter Williamson, who has invested hundreds of thousands of pounds during his 10 years at Yarmouth’s Merrivale Model Village, said longer holidays outside the summer would not work for outdoor attractions - and he predicted it would send prices rocketing for families during the shorter school summer holiday. Mr Lewis confirmed he would be meeting local tourism leaders to learn about their concerns before the bill came back to the House of Commons. However, he said: “The Government has been putting power back in the hands of schools, moving away from Labour’s top-down approach to education. “The changes in the Deregulation Bill will allow schools to respond to the needs of their children and the preferences of their parents. Many schools have already used these powers to the benefit of their pupils. I think that it is important that schools have the power to deliver the most suitable educational timetable for their students to be best placed for the future.” Tweet Share Email this article to a friend To send a link to this page you must be logged in. 11 comments Great Yarmouth should be put out of its misery. Add your comment | Report this comment norman hall Wednesday, September 17, 2014 I am currently in Valencia, Spain on a half board seven day break in a four star hotel.It cost me £370. Yet GYBC and the other rulers of the council being the touristy lot are scratching their heads as to why their 'lovely' town with it's parking fees is struggling?...... I think another foreign holiday is in order. Add your comment | Report this comment wes1975 Wednesday, September 17, 2014 Great Yarmouth is dying now, so to reduce the main season by 2 weeks and make the situation worse defies logic... This said the proposed 1000 houses to be built near the James Paget hospital will create more traffic and hospital A & E stress and problems... getting in and out of GY in the summer not good for businesses and tourists...if you increase the population beyond an acceptable limit for the services to cope with and lack of jobs many will suffer and be under pressure. I like shave ideas about GY seafront and amusement arcades are not one of them... GY needs something new and sort out the parking which looses many local trade .. from Gorleston and other areas... and Norwich benefits by such poor shopping in GY.. The Empire and Marketplace CO-OP Building shut for many years and the Britannia Pier shut 40 weeks a year .. must tell people something. No wonder tourist trade has dropped the past 20 years and guest houses going over the benefit claimers for all year round income. With people with little money to spend locally. Things to do on GY seafront in the evening in June and July is nothing....Even the fairground is shut.. School holidays in August is ok for the UK .. But going abroad can be far to HOT at 40c and too crowded to travel. if 4 weeks is reduced from 6 weeks the 2 weeks affected may not be summer weeks... which makes matter worse. all round. Add your comment | Report this comment Lionel Monday, September 15, 2014 I agree with Albert Jones, Peter Jay and Tony Smith. A 4 week school summer holiday would make the already too-short British main holiday season too short to sustain funfairs, theatres, attractions. \"Do-gooers\" may want school terms of exact length etc. but the weather in this country isn't kind in October. Add your comment | Report this comment Mick Castle Sunday, September 14, 2014 \"Holiday changes would kill Yarmouth....\", sadly I think Yarmouth was killed a long time ago based on it's current state & the type of people who are increasingly moving there, I feel for the people trying to run their businesses & make it a better place, but you won't get any help from the Tories, they're largely responsible for it's current degenerative state. Add your comment | Report this comment DocScott Sunday, September 14, 2014 Gorleston Expat, I totally agree. Rather than moan about changing school holidays (a change which I feel is more beneficial for children's education) perhaps the local tourist industry should try and be a little more creative about its offering, which might in turn extend it's season. Unfortunately much of it is currently based around tacky shops selling overpriced cheap and nasty rubbish and amusement arcades, ie minimum effort for maximum return. It feels like there is very little attempt to provide any sort of quality, value for money holiday. There are a small number of nice eateries and one or two decent attractions such as the Time & Tide museum but they are in the minority. Add your comment | Report this comment Row71 Saturday, September 13, 2014 Lets turn this argument on its head..... Rather than a six-week summer holiday period being compressed into four; surely the converse is true? If schools are not forced to have their summer holidays betwen the last week of July and the beginning of September, would this not mean that many holiday makers could then take their holidays in June or at the beginning of July? The kids are still ging to get holidays, so this is a real opportunity for the season to be extended. The real challenge is for tourism-related business in Yarmouth to invest in providing visitors with a quality holiday-experience so they will stay longer, and come back more frequently. Add your comment | Report this comment Gorleston-Ex-Pat Saturday, September 13, 2014 Yarmouth's economy should not be based on tourism. It is a Victorian mindset and has held us back as a town for too long. We need to MAKE things. We need to generate our own wealth not be reliant on others charity for 6 weeks every year. Will there be casualties from moving towards this? Yes, but they should have diversified long ago. the archaic grip these cockle and whelk salesmen have over the running of this town is hilarious. Add your comment | Report this comment Steady On Wednesday, September 10, 2014 I don't understand why everyone is against the change to the school holidays, if you go by the standard of exam results these days and the standard of English and spelling these days, kids need more school rather than long holidays. Why is everyone worried about losing money if the six weeks is shortened, if the schools stagger the holidays between Spring and Autumn, the weather would be fine. Half Term at Easter could be lengthened and perhaps a week in May or June. Is there an underlying issue here that these businesses don't want to open for a longer time during the year. If Yarmouth didn't close half it's shops and attractions during what is 'off season', they might get more money coming in anyway, with so many places closed, no-one wants to come here. Open up the place.

[Skinner is] accused of using his expenses to pay £10,000 to his ex-wife. Skinner, 56, is also alleged to have used some of the cash to repair the gearbox on his ex-wife Julie Skinner’s Land Rover Discovery and funded hotel stays, restaurants and jewellery by claiming a maximum £480,000 for support staff over five years. One member of staff, Karen Forbes, was said to have invoiced the former MEP for the South East of England Region, for more than £122,000 in 2005, but worked at Tesco and was actually paid just £525 a month, Southwark Crown Court has heard. MPs and peers convicted of parliamentary expenses fraud invariably received custodial sentences. The courts rightly take this type of fraud very seriously. The trial court has received evidence from European Parliament officials and highlighted the gross inadequacy of limited checks on expenses in the Parliament. MEPs can claim £120,000 a year in expenses without providing “real proof” of how the money is spent, because EU officials don’t want to saddle them with an “administrative burden” which would hamper their freedom. EU expenses chief Frank Antoine-Poirel said that only on “very limited occasions” would MEPs be asked for “real proof” of where MEPs allowances ended up. That is a situation that should not continue.  MEPs should be subject to checks at least as tight as those imposed on MPs and most civil servants.  There should be no claims without receipts, for a start. The trial continues. * Antony Hook was #2 on the South East European list in 2014, is the English Party's representative on the Federal Executive and produces this sites EU Referendum Roundup.

I’ve dubbed it Obsessive Compulsive Time Trial Disorder. In short it’s the inability to let even the slightest of errors go when playing a racing game. Missed the apex on turn 3? Restart. Clipped a curb and spun out? Restart. Braked too early for that hairpin and lost a position? Restart. It’s an incredibly time consuming and not a little bit masochistic way to play, and one I feel I’m cheating myself with.

Picture by Paul Chesterton/Focus Images Ltd ©Focus Images Limited www.focus-images.co.uk +447814 482222 Where do you start in assessing all things Norwich City at the moment? shares Share linkLink shares Important issues dealt with at AGM It was as interesting as ever at the Norwich City AGM. It can be a relaxing evening for those of us sent to report on the latest business bulletin coming out of Norwich City because we get the night off from asking the questions. It’s a chance for the club’s shareholders to take centre stage while we jot down the questions and answers. It’s always heartening when the questions follow the same sort of flow to the ones that we’ve been asking for the past few weeks at the regular press conferences when we get the chance to talk to Neil Adams. Fingers are closer to pulses in the Norfolk press pack than you might think. However, the first question from the floor came as something of a shock. Faced with a heavily loaded top table which included David McNally, Alan Bowkett, Delia Smith, Michael Wynn Jones and Michael Foulger alongside Adams, this was the City shareholders’ annual opportunity to get some answers. Would the first question be about City’s rapidly deteriorating league form, Mike Phelan’s appointment or the financial cost of Premier League relegation? It was none of the above. “Can you tell me why the Radio Norfolk commentary position has moved from above the tunnel?” I probably went redder than a defender who has just left his man unmarked at a corner. On reflection, it was quite exciting to be at the centre of a burning issue and I’ve never felt more relevant. If only our friendly shareholder had been reading their EDP they would have known the answer from this column a few months ago. Pouring over the wreckage left by the 2-1 defeat by Reading is like coming home to find you have disturbed a burglary. Something’s missing, it’s not immediately clear what and there is an awful lot of sorting out to do. It was as if the Canaries players had decided to put on a 90-minute dramatic reconstruction of their season so far for the benefit of new first-team coach Mike Phelan. Some promising attacks that faded away quicker than the career of an X Factor finalist at one end while at the other two more goals conceded that were so soft they could feature in a dreamy advert for a high-end brand of fabric conditioner. All that was missing for Phelan was a stern American voiceover artist whispering “previously, at Carrow Road” in his ear before kick-off. There’s no need for him to catch up on the yellow and green box set, the first 45 minutes of the Reading game were enough to bring Neil Adams’ new right-hand man up to speed. In isolation this was one very disappointing defeat but the colour is draining out of the bigger picture very quickly. Adams’ post-match “we are in a bad place” comment was underlined by three significant signs that what started as a ‘blip’ has already become something altogether less ‘blippy’ and more serious. Firstly, those players not in the team are growing in value every week. The stricken Ryan Bennett and Wes Hoolahan, pictured, are both reliable Championship performers but the longer they go unscarred by sitting out a dreadful run which currently stands at one win in 10 matches, the more they get held up as potential saviours. The same thing happened to Elliott Bennett last season. His long-term injury meant he missed all but two games of City’s Premier League campaign. With each week that went by and as a relegation battle became a losing one he was missed more and more by the fantasy football managers in the stands. When that starts happening it’s clear that trouble is brewing. The same goes for the level of activity on the Canary Call phone lines. The BBC Radio Norfolk switchboard was jammed solid on Saturday as fans searched for an outlet at which to vent their spleen. During the successive promotions brought on by the Paul Lambert regime, spurious debates about the usefulness or otherwise of playing music at the ground to celebrate goals had to be started to winkle a few callers out of the woodwork. It stands to reason that people are moved to pick up the phone when they’re unhappy rather than satisfied. I bet your energy supplier has a ‘Complaints Hotline’ but no ‘Praise Hotline’. I’ve never phoned my electricity provider to thank them for their hard work. Lastly, and perhaps most worrying, is the increasing hostility being exchanged between players and fans on social media. It’s wonderful to be able to get unedited, honest opinions from players after a game. They get well paid and so have to suck up some of the inevitable criticism that will come their way as being part of the job but when constructive comment makes way for 140 characters worth of abuse it is a sad state of affairs. There was a TV shot of Mike Phelan in the dugout on Saturday and his jaw was going 10 to the dozen as he turned a piece of gum round and round in his mouth like a sizeable chip off the old Sir Alex Ferguson block. But has he bitten off more than he can chew? As his own American voiceover artist might say, “stay tuned for the next exciting instalment”. shares Share linkLink shares 3 comments Mellow, In your continual efforts to 'stick it' to those who just happen to not agree with your opinions, I feel you have misinterpreted this article. There is no way that Goreham was having a go at Phelan. I assume you were of the few who defended Hughton and as a pre-requisite for those of that faith, needed to slag off those that didn't agree with you. It appears from previous threads you are fitting the bill perfectly. Chill out - we all have differing views. I happen to think you're way off the mark.

Here’s a look at a pair of games we’ve been playing recently, and our thoughts on whether they're worth a punt or not. Read more Tags board games, boardgame iPhone review: Epic Win Posted on 14th Sep 2010 at 11:16 by Alex Watson with 6 comments Surely you must have played the Game of Life? It was a board game that always appealed to me; partly because it had a clicky spinning wheel instead of regular dice, but also because of the neatness of the whole experience - the well behaved blue and pink pegs, the salary that always came in on time, the guarantee that insurance and university really did pay off. Perhaps it's no surprise then that I'm a big believer in organizing my real life with lots of lists - I have tried full-on GTD but really what I prefer are just to do lists, on paper, so that I can underline, star and vigorously score out entries when they're done. Even better is the act of feeding the whole list to the shredder when everything is done. I've been playing around with a new iPhone app called Epic Win, which in some ways is like a 21st century Game of Life. Specifically it's the game of your life.

My parents took a dim view of that sort of thing and funnelled me towards adventure and puzzle games instead. I can look back happily now, glad that I ended up playing Monkey Island rather than Mortal Kombat, but I was actually quite annoyed about it at the time. I swore, childishly, that when I got older I would play whatever games I damn well pleased, whenever I wanted – but things didn’t quite turn out that way. Well, OK, mostly they did, but let's not get distracted from this story... The point is that, while I have a copy of Monopoly sat on a shelf in my wardrobe, I’ve learned that I’m better off sticking to different types of games. I’ve banned myself from playing it under any circumstances.

I’m also something of a board game fiend – a fan of games in any form, to tell the truth. In the last few months I’ve especially enjoyed getting together with a few friends to play some board games, and that enjoyment is hopefully going to be buoyed further by a recent discovery of mine. I found a really cool shop in the centre of nearby Reading – one which I’ve walked past many times but only recently investigated. It’s called Eclectic Games and is a board game and collectible card game specialist. Eclectic Games is very much My Kind Of Place. It’s large and warmly decorated, with a huge selection of games, both niche and well-known. It also has a library of games - which you’re free to try out in the gaming hall out back - and the owners regularly organise events where you can meet other gamers and get involved in tournaments. It’s small enough to be charming and independent too – exactly the type of place I’d like to support with my patronage.

Archant Police are appealing for help identifying a suspected burglar targeting homes in Exmouth. Police in Exmouth have released an Evofit image of man they would like to speak to in connection with a series of burglaries across East, South and Mid Devon. Officers said a home in Mount Pleasant Avenue, Exmouth, was burgled sometime between October 4 and 17, while the occupants were on holiday. Police said property stolen in the raid included a number of earrings, gold rings, a locket, a ladies wristwatch, a gold bangle and a service medal. A Devon and Cornwall police spokesperson said: “Police are investigating the possibility that the burglary is linked to an ongoing series of similar burglaries throughout Devon, and are keen to identify and trace an unknown man depicted in this EvoFit image, who was seen by witnesses in the area.” If you have information to help police, contact DC Carly Davies on 101 quoting crime reference CR/107364/14, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Project manager Rob Kendon was speaking as artwork by Bingley school pupils was officially unveiled on hoardings around the site. Children from Crossflatts Primary School, Eldwick Primary School, Myrtle Park Primary School, Lady Lane Park School, Priestthorpe Primary School, St Joseph’s Catholic Primary School and Trinity All Saints Church of England Primary School created 21 pieces which are now on display . Retail giant Sainsbury’s, which owns the building, is on the brink of demolishing the former office block, which was earmarked as a possible supermarket site at one point. The company recently opened a Local convenience store on Main Street, in Bingley, employing 25 people. Project manager Mr Kendon said: \"We are almost ready to start work to demolish the former Bradford & Bingley headquarters.\" He added that he was \"thrilled\" to unveil the new artwork. Mr Kendon said: \"There are clearly some very talented young Hockneys in Bingley and these brilliantly unique images will help to make the hoardings more eye-catching.\" The artwork is themed around living in Bingley, with many of the pieces featuring images of local landmarks such as the five-rise locks, Myrtle Park and the surrounding countryside. Many also include depictions of the schools the children attend. Hilary Craven, headteacher at Crossflatts Primary School, said: \"We’re delighted to be involved in this community project and I know our children will be very impressed to see their work displayed in such a prominent position in Bingley.\" Gill Wilson, the headteacher at Lady Lane Park School, added: \"Bingley is such a beautiful little town and what a wonderful idea to invite the children of the town to supply some artwork to be shared and enjoyed by all. \"How proud they are of what they've done and what an acknowledgement that children are the citizens of the future.\" Christina Gunning, headteacher at Priestthorpe Primary School, said pupils were proud to be part of such a historic moment. \"As a school we are always keen to get our children involved with local developments and environmental projects like this,\" she added. The headteacher at Eldwick Primary School, Janice Kershaw, said children involved had enjoyed every minute. \"They are really proud that all their hard work is now one display,\" she added. Passer-by retired gas fitter Ken Jones of Bingley said the site much improved already. \"The children's pictures are lovely, and I also like stone wall print on one side and the dense leaves on hoardings going up to Myrtle Park,\" said Mr Jones, 77.
